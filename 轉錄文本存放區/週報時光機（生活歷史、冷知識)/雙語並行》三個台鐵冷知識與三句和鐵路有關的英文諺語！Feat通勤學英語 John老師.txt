(00:00~01:01) Hello guys and welcome to another special episode of vocab with myself and 周寶四光機Patrick Hi 大家好 我是Patrick That's right Patrick every month we will have special episodes like this A special feature between me and Patrick and today we are going to be tackling some other trivia That is totally new to me so I'm going to pass the mic to Patrick now OK 好 我們今天要來講一些冷知識 那這個冷知識呢 對教老師來說可能是比較陌生的 但其實對臺灣的人來講 我們知道臺灣之前曾經被稱作鐵道王國 所以我們今天要來講一些跟 Railway 或是跟 Tren 有關的一些冷知識 同時也要請教老師 will introduce some idioms and phrases that is related to Railway
(01:01~02:02) 或是Tren 對 我們有很多很多的 idioms and phrases and expressions for trains and tracks 所以我們會 cover them as we go along 所以這是第一條的 trivia 因為我非常不 familiar with Railways Railway stations and Railway lines 因為我的年輕人在 South Africa 我們會走到哪裡 我們不會走到鐵道 Most of the trains and the Railway services are for cargo Not for people 啊 貨物啊 OK So it's kind of different in Taiwan you know The main many people will go on the train 不管是通勤啊 從臺中到臺北啊 臺北到高雄 很多人會搭鐵 甚至是 if you want to go to Hua Lian or Taitung You have to go on Tren right or maybe drive on yourself Because there's no high speed railway so we have to go for the train First trivia I would like to ask John Do you know how many trains stations are there in Taiwan 這叫幾個火車站 How many Railway stations
(02:02~03:03) We're talking about Taiwan Railways Administration TRA right we're not talking about high speed rail We're not talking about the cargo rail We're talking about the passenger railway lines OK let me guess OK I am really sucking this out of my thumb OK We have 22 counties in Taiwan I'm gonna go 128 128 but the exactly number is two times more Seriously There's 241 這個有這麼多 241 Railway stations Yes 這是臺鐵官網 它截至民國110年底 統計出來臺鐵的全線總共有241座車站 營運的里程總長度是1065公里 How many kilometers in total length 1,000 Yes 1,065 kilometers You know let me give you a distance An idea of the distance OK give you a measurement Patrick from my town
(03:03~04:05) Bloomfontein in South Africa To Cape Town is 1,000 kilometers Oh my We have to drive 10 hours to Cape Town Holy shh 10 hours You know right Now you tell me We have 240 41 41 stations Yes And the total length of our railway line is 1,000 Yes So technically it Go around Taiwan three times Oh yes 2 to 3 times 2.5 times at least So it's from my city Bloomfontein to Cape Town Literally 1,000 kilometers I wonder so 10 hours You drive alone or with your family Oh no no no no no no I mean with long distance travel like that If you drive by yourself You got to go slow You got to go easy right But if we go on a family trip Every Christmas You know I went to Cape Town With my family like three or four times In my life I mean it's 1,000 kilometers right And then it's 1,000 kilometers back So total
(04:05~05:06) You know without driving anywhere else It's 2,000 kilometers already Clucked on your car Oh Imagine that right If you go around Cape Town If you visit some places Then it's another 200 300 kilometers At least Mmm Yeah So imagine that's one holiday One vacation Holy cow So for us driving You know 1,000 kilometers Is like man you know Not a big deal It's a thing But the problem is It depends on how many people You are on the car And then also how often you rest If you don't rest We have tried on one road trip We have tried only resting one time And we arrived in 11 hours Oh it's still a long trip Yeah you know non-stop Technically we took bathroom breaks And then we both take away to eat on the car We didn't really take a break And then one holiday When I was a lot bigger When I could drive That particular holiday
(05:06~06:07) We drove for almost 12 and a half hours To 13 hours So we started driving at 5 o'clock in the morning And then we arrived somewhere along the lines of Plus rest up plus everything We arrived I remember somewhere like 6 or 7 o'clock at night It's hard to imagine You know that Taiwan We want to drive like 10 hours a trip We don't know where can we go No you know why in Taiwan If you drive 10 hours You only get to like Galsheng or somewhere Because of our highways Right our highways run in the mountains So you can't drive 120 kilometers per hour You can't drive full speed It's because all our highways are in the mountains Or along the coast And if you drive along the coast They are cross winds And there are so many different weather issues At play So you shouldn't And in Taiwan our freeway and highway
(06:07~07:07) Maximum speed is 110 kilometers We can't drive over that And maybe we got the traffic jam Yes and then traffic jam at every major city Right yeah Going into major city out of every major city So in Taiwan most of the time the road trips They are not one single road trip You know from Taipei to Galsheng Most of the time most people what I hear is They like to make different stops along the way Yeah So Taiwan rail wow Okay 1000k Okay this is the first trivia about Taiwan's railway 241 stations And the kilometers like 1065 kilometers 1065 That's not bad Yes that's not bad Okay wow So let's introduce one idiom to our listeners Okay I got one for you This idiom we will use in situations where Something has already happened And there's nothing you can do about it It sounds sad Okay Or the particular opportunity
(07:07~08:21) Or the chance has left It's gone Right no more chance to do something Okay So this idiom uses the keyword train So the train has left the station Or that train has left the station It's good to imagine right The train left we can't do anything Yes and similarly This is a bonus idiom for you guys So we are also an island Right we are an island country So we are also very familiar with our ships and vessels Yes So we can also say the boat has sailed That ship has sailed or that boat has sailed It's the same idea Nothing you can do Bye bye No more opportunity So here's the example sentence for you guys I thought the internship program was still open But it looks like that train has left the station
(08:21~09:22) Yeah too late too bad You can't change the situation anymore Right It's a fact It's a fact now 這類似的這樣的概念 So that train has left the station And also you know another context That most us men don't like to get involved in Is breakups Right Yeah You know sometimes you want to make it up To your girlfriend or your wife And then they're just very angry And you know they might want to break up And unfortunately sometimes they will just tell you The train has left the station It's nothing It's a missed opportunity Nothing you can do This is a bad situation Ouch You can't do anything You can't do anything That ship has sailed Bye bye 好 這是我們今天的第一個這個 EDIM 這聽起來非常難 過目已成中 That train has left the station Ok
(09:22~10:24) Ok There's another trivia about our railway Ok So I would first like to ask John We know that main line 我們知道主線就叫the main line嘛 The main line Yes 那臺鐵的支線這個英文要怎麼說呢 Ok Usually in English It'll be the main line Or the primary line Or we can say the railway line Ok Yes And for example like highways We will say number one highway Number two highway Right National highway That kind of idea And I think For railway tracks and railway lines We probably would use the word branch lines Oh branch Yeah like a tree branch Right you branch out B-R-A-N-C-H Yes that's right So it's a branch line Ok branch line Ok So the next trivia is about the branch line Exactly Do you know how many branch lines 就是現在臺鐵還有多少條支線 是有在營運當中的 Ok
(10:24~11:24) So how many branch lines are still in service Yes Oh this is interesting Because we just covered the number of stations So If you have 241 stations in total Nationwide I mean you can't tell me We only have like 10 branch lines It doesn't make sense right It must be more than that Mhm I'm gonna go If I say 50 I think it's too much Oh too too much Right it's too many branch lines If it's 50 So I'm gonna go with somewhere in between Let me say 30 35 35 30 35 Unfortunately There's only seven What Yes there's only seven lines Seven branch lines Yeah So why Why the branch lines are so few Right 這個 這個爲什麼呢 其實跟臺灣之前的這個 這個產業的轉業有關係啊 我們知道以前臺灣 當時不管是日治時期或清零時期 其實很多的開坑都是要運送 木材 煤炭或是這套 For cargo right
(11:24~12:24) Yeah the cargo Transporting wood Transporting the commodities Metals Gold mines And the coal mines Yeah something Sugar cane Yeah okay 這個是之前在那個時候的產業時期 但是我們的支線呢 就是爲了要輔助這些東西 可以從山裏面運送出來 Oh yeah 所以之前可能都是跟的那些 不管是林廠啊煤礦廠 這樣的去合作 但是隨着產業的轉型 煤礦廠跟林廠已經逐漸的視爲了 那這些支線逐漸就被廢掉 加上臺灣是比較地下人仇的狀況 Yes 所以很多地方之後就把這個鐵路支線給廢棄了 甚至是轉型變觀光鐵路 導致很多支線 就從以前可能十幾條二十幾條慢慢說說說 變成現在四下六條 Yes Makes sense That makes sense Because most of the branch lines I mean back in the heyday Right back in the days when You know mining wood industry Everything was booming
(12:24~13:25) Maybe they were 25 30 branch lines But right now it's more for tourism Yeah The most famous branch line in Taiwan is like 平息線 Or maybe 內灣線 I know I know Pingxi Yeah we go there to have the sky lantern Yes You can light the sky lantern I went there twice Very nice It's a lovely place Yeah And very historical streets there You can have some That's old streets Yeah old streets and go around the railway Something like that Yeah Okay So this is the second one Very cool We got six branch lines And one very very famous one It's the 阿里山 Railway Oh 阿里山嶺天 Yes But it's used for tourism now Right Yeah We go on and go up to the mountains Yes The altitude is like 2000m Really 2000m above sea level Yeah It is the highest point of Taiwan's railway In 阿里山 Yeah So it's very famous around the world Many foreigners
(13:25~14:25) You come to here and visit there Yes It's iconic You know you don't only go to 阿里山 for the hiking You also want to go on the little train ride Go around the 阿里山 Yeah exactly Very very nice Okay So this is the second trivia And then we go for the second idioms Okay So I got one for you Since we talk about 阿里山 train Okay The 阿里山 Railway So 阿里山 Railway And the trains are very iconic Right Because I remember back in the day To be honest with you I still haven't taken the rail line Oh Me too I didn't I've never taken the railway line on 阿里山 I don't know why I think the last The one memory I had When I was what Maybe four years old When we were still in Taiwan My dad took me to Shito And then that was it We didn't get on the train and everything So I've only heard about this Okay Okay But I've got one for you Talking about the train So when we say For example in this context
(14:25~15:27) Right When we can jump out a good opportunity We call that a gravy train Oh Gravy train Money making opportunity Or a money making scheme Or a money making career You can say Oh you're jumping on the gravy train So gravy and train Doesn't sound right Because gravy is the meat sauce You know the sauce that you put on Your mashed potatoes And on your side dish That's gravy 肉汁 Yes So gravy train Sounds like it's a lot of meat juice It's square It's a train full of meat juice But if you think about it When we talk about meat Right We talk about money opportunities And you know Positive stuff You know So if you jump on the gravy train It means It's probably a good opportunity It's a money making opportunity Okay So I think this is Very much related to Ali Mountain Right If the Ali Mountain
(15:27~16:27) operates in full capacity It's a gravy train It's a money making train as well And now if you work In the semiconductor industry As an engineer It's the gravy train too But it's not very easy to It's not very easy But gravy train means You know you make money You know it's a money making opportunity It's a gravy train So here's the example sentence Jack hopped on the gravy train When he married his wife Whose family owns One of the largest property companies In the world Lucky man Yes So he jumped on the gravy train Or he hopped on the gravy train When he married his wife Because his wife comes from a wealthy family Family Okay 所以這句話如果翻成中文 大概就是 傑克代結婚之後 可以說是不老而獲 因為他的老婆是來自世界上 屬於屬於的房產家族 Okay
(16:27~17:30) He's living the high life It's easy Good money all the way Good career Lucky guy Yes So similarly today If you are an AI engineer Software engineer Working in Silicon Valley Yeah it's the gravy train You're now on the right train On the right track You are on the gravy train Yes For the rest of us We are watching the gravy train drive by And we never get up the train Okay 然後這就是第二個意點 It's about gravy train 就是不老而獲或者是肥缺的意思 Yes Okay So we'll go for the third trivia All right I would like to ask John So we're talking about six branch line Let me quickly introduce the name of them Yes Okay 所以第一個叫生澳線 第二個是平息線 第三個是六加線 第四個是內灣 第五個是吉吉 第六個是沙崙線 Hang on a second I've heard of Gigi somewhere Yeah in Nantou
(17:30~18:30) Yeah Gigi station is a very popular station Right Yeah For tourists Yeah you can go to like Gigi And go to Turton There's a place called Turton And there are very famous fruit There is called banana 南投的八角是很有名的 Okay Yes Okay this is another trivia for everyone The mini bananas Yes The mini bananas The mini banana Yes Okay So six of the branch line Yes Let's make a guess Okay Make a guess about Do you know which branch line Stop the most train station Which branch line has the most train stations Yeah 總共最多站 停靠最多站的是哪一條支線呢 Okay So can you read me the six lines again Okay The first one Yes 深澳縣 So深澳 Right Where is that from where to where Okay 深澳大概就是在臺灣的北海岸 這裡 North Coast
(18:30~19:31) Yeah the North Coast 這裡其實有很多很有趣的點 那這邊最有名的一個 觀光的資源呢 就是在這邊可以騎鐵到自行車 You can ride a bike on the railway I think riding a bike everywhere in Taiwan now is the thing Right People like to ride bicycles But it's There's a very special part It's that your bike is only on the railway You can get off the railway Really 它是跟著這個鐵道上面的 這個叫他車 它是騎在這個鐵軌正上方的 它不像是我們騎在 Yeah 它這個 那個算是我原本要去 但是因為遇到颱風啊就沒有去 所以我也很想去 Sounds like a very interesting trip Wow Yeah I would like to go there But the typhoon came So I didn't finish the trip You should go on the trip Okay Oh interesting Okay so that's the Sennau line And what's the next line Pingxi right Yeah Pingxi
(19:31~20:34) Pingxi is sort of like a short I think I'm gonna eliminate Pingxi Because I know Pingxi is very short Yep Yes That's more for tourists So I'm gonna eliminate that So Sennau maybe but not definitely not Pingxi The next one 嗯 六家汐 And where is that from From where to where Is that line If somebody from Xinzhu They want to go to the high speed railway They will go on Liu Jiaxian 它比較定位是要 從臺鐵搭到高鐵站的時候 Okay from Xinzhu So it's local train Local commute Yeah Okay thank you very much Eliminate this one Okay so the next one It's Nei Wan Xian Ney Wan Where is Nei Wan Ney Wan is still there in Xinzhu Oh so in Xinzhu Yeah there's a very famous Hestroiko Street 口內灣老街 Okay Yeah and there's a famous food called Jinger Lily Rice Dumpling 野江花糉 Really never heard of that You know after all your trivia I don't feel very Taiwanese
(20:34~21:34) I should throw away my Taiwan passport You may have the trip Let go somewhere Go on the trip Go on the branch line or something Yeah okay Nei Wan I'm gonna leave it there I think Nei Wan is a possibility But little jia doesn't sound like A very long line So now you keep two of them I send out in Nei Wan Yeah Okay the next one is Ji Ji Xian Ji Ji Yes I am going to say I also want to eliminate Ji Ji Because I think that's also a touristy line So I'm gonna eliminate Ji Ji Okay the last one The last one is Sha Lun Xian Sha Lun This one is in Tai Zhong No no no it's in Tai 應該說他算是在 呃臺南啦 Similar like Liu Jia Xian Okay It's a local local local branch line It will go to like 高鐵的時候就可以搭 這個時候繼續臺南高鐵站啊 Interesting So I've got three now Yeah send out
(21:34~22:36) Nei Wan and Sha Lun I've got three now and I gotta choose one Oh I'm gonna go Sha Lun Sha Lun probably because down south There are more stations It's a longer branch line I'm gonna go for Sha Lun Okay nice guess But the true answer The correct one The correct answer It's Nei Wan Xian Ah done it Done it I was close But it's nice guess Yeah yeah Nei Wan Xian 總共停了13站 This is 目前 對這個支線裡面 停最多的一個 Is Nei Wan a branch line going into the mountains or to the coast It's kind of going to the mountains Yeah 而且它是橫跨了新竹市跟新竹縣的一條直線 那當初它其實是 一開始是為了水泥業跟我們剛剛講到這個 林業的發展去興建的 但後來這個產業更疊嘛 所以它就慢慢的變成是 深入這些老街旅遊的時候 可以去逛的 There's a very famous festival there
(22:36~23:37) So you can go Nei Wan to see the fireflies During May or April I heard I heard of that Fireflies But again You know people in Taipei We can go see fireflies Almost every day Yeah I hear somewhere in Tucheng You can also see fireflies And then somewhere in Pingxi Jingguasi or North Coast You can also go see fireflies Yven Xiangshan 這裡 Xiangshan 你聽說也有 Xiangshan的另外一邊有虎山 Yeah the tiger mountain Oh 虎山 Yes somebody told me about that There's a firefly Okay It's not so It's very common in Taipei Okay So this is the trivia about it 最多這個 挺靠最多站的支線是內彎線 Okay So talking about How many train stops there are Or railway stations there are in the line You know when we talk about railway I remember my first trip back to Taiwan Because my mom is Hakka And she's from Zhongli
(23:37~24:38) So we had to take the local train to Nei Li And you know local trains are very slow So I'm very impatient And to me it's a Yeah it's a very different experience So you know my mom took me on this local train Took hours and then you know My brother and I we were very annoyed And then we were just being voice They were very very impatient So my mom on the way back said Oh then we can take the express train So she had my uncle take us I remember I think it was Taoyuan station Or Zhongli station One of the biggest stations And then from the biggest station We took the express train back to Taipei It was like 30 minutes or 40 minutes It was you know quite fast And then we had seats You know the local trains It's sort of benches on the sides And then when you get on the express trains You have seats So this is I think the one Idium that will relate to all this That we've discussed
(24:38~25:38) Is to go on the fast track Ah you get more time That's right So think about it If you take the express train Right you get there faster So just now we talked about the gravy train Right it's nothing about speed But it's just juicy A lot of opportunities Good opportunities Okay money train But this one is talking about speed To go on the fast track Or get on the fast track Okay so fast track Is the same as a railway track Once you're on the fast track That means you are moving forward Very very quickly You are not on the local train You are on the express train Yes Okay and obviously Back in the day When this idiom was created Think about it They weren't high speed rails available Right if we have to update This idiom It'll be on the high speed rail Yeah yeah It makes sense Or maybe bullet tracks Yes on the bullet track
(25:38~26:38) Something like that But fast track means Hey you do something very quickly Or this is the path To getting it done quicker Okay走 有點像走到捷徑 那個如虎天翼的感覺 Yes and then also It can also use to describe that That say Oh after hearing from Patrick About your project progress I can comment and say Oh you are on the fast track You are almost done With your project You know you finished early So you are on the fast track Yes Or when you do presentations You tell us We are on the fast track We will finish 20% Ahead of the deadline Tiqian wan gong The feeling of Yeah or two days ahead of the deadline So we are on the fast track Okay So again using internship as an example The example sentence This internship opportunity Can equip you with the experience you need
(26:38~27:39) To be on the fast track for manager Okay So it is This internship experience Can make you Be on the path you are going to be More like a tiger Yeah to speed up the progress getting there Okay Fast finish To achieve the goal you want to achieve The little goal Okay Get on the fast track to becoming a manager Alright So that is the trivia and the idioms for today About the trends and the branch line And the railway Thank you very much Patrick So let's quickly recap today We've got three English idioms That pertains to Trains and tracks Right So the first one The train has left the station When something is already done You can't change it anymore Yeah事情已經成定局了 目以成周了 這種感覺 And then the next one is Gravy train The meat juice train Which means that it's a good career It's a good opportunity Or it could be A good project that you're taking on Money making project 肥圈 For that matter
(27:39~28:40) And then the next one That you may be able to use On a daily basis You want to be on the fast track Or you want to get on the fast track Of getting somewhere Okay 這有點像找到一個好的捷徑 快速成功的道路 如虎天翼的感覺 Yeah That's right So that's all the time we got For you 15 mins fam And我們的這個周報時光機的報由 So please comment down below Use the comment link And let us know Which of these trivia did you get right Okay You know why I want to ask this Patrick Because I don't feel very Taiwanese after tonight So I want to know if you guys You know our 15 mins fam Or Zobac's Guangxi family If you guys feel the same way I do I have to say Not many people know about these trivia Nobody will count how many Transtations are learning Taiwan right Go ask your parents Go ask your parents
