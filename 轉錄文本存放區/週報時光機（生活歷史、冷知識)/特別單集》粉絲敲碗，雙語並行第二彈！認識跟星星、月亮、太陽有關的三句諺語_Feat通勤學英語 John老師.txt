(00:00~01:00) Hello Hello and welcome to another episode of Vocab with John and Patrick 大家好,歡迎收聽周寶石公雞跟通勤學英語的單元 我們再次的合體合作啦 That's right you guys So we've had a lot of requests after our previous episode didn't we Patrick Yes,我們收到了很多 positive comments 正面的評價 就是有聽眾來這邊跟我講 然後也有到教老師那邊去反應說 覺得這樣英文加歷史 然後再加一點閒聊的成分 可以讓大家快速地去認識到一些諺語的故事起源 那對於這個諺語的認識就會更深入了 There we go That's how we learn idioms now Patrick So it's up to you to explain the history behind it And now I have to speak English all the way So you'll be the Chinese speaker from here on out 沒錯我們就是這個
(01:00~02:01) John老師負責英文解釋的部分 那我負責講解中文的內容 當然大家既然這麼喜歡都敲完了 我們這樣的諺語的合作方式 所以在未來呢 我們每一個月都會推出一集這樣的內容 希望大家可以在過程當中 認識到英文諺語 也同時學習到這個諺語背後的一些故事啦 There we go So once a month Patrick and I We would be sharing all the back stories To all the interesting idioms That we dig up online or And on our teaching material So Patrick Last time we did three idioms How many idioms are we going to do today? It's the same We have three idioms today Not more Oh no no no no I know three is enough If too much 有些人可能這個吸收的程度 過了太多 五個可能不好容易進 我覺得三個是一個 比較標準的一個數量啦 Yes So three is a charm Yes Ok so 上一次呢 我們講到的是一些動物的一點
(02:01~03:02) 包含像是狗的 貓的跟兔子的 但是今天我們三個諺語呢 We're going to up the sky 我們來看一下 stars Sun 跟 moon 對我們有一個不同的主題 讓大家可以去學習 So we're going to be looking up the sky for clues now Yes So what would be the first idiom Patrick Ok 我們今天呢 從白天講到夜晚 So the first one 我們來講一些跟太陽算有關的 那這個諺語呢 麻煩匠老師幫我念一下 Alright So our first idiom today is to make hay while the sun shines Yes to make hay while the sun shines Hey 這個字呢 不是 he way the hay ok 我們是 he way hy是乾草的意思 等一下匠老師會多補充 那我先來講一下這個諺語 他的概念是什麼 Hey是乾草 那乾草我們想到的 就可能是在農場上面 會看到的一些東西 就這樣這個動物的飼料等等 那乾草的組成呢
(03:02~04:04) 就包含了像麥草啊 豆類的植物啊 根精葉啊 然後還有木樹呀等等 那之前啊在這個古代的時候 這個農場農夫 他們要餵食他們的牧場的動物 必須用乾草這樣的 嗯哼 布品去餵食 那主要是因為 乾草的營養價值比較高 但是據說 哎 教老師可能就不知道啦 這乾草的保存 其實不是那麼容易哦 yep ok why 為什麼呢 那是因為天氣如果太乾燥啊 或者是太炎熱 乾草可能會起火 you burn and maybe it will burn the farm right so 可能會造成火災 但是如果要太潮濕 太潮濕又會讓乾草可能資深戲劇 那其中的營養價值 或者裡面的一些蛋白質 就會被破壞掉 那就沒有辦法補充到動物所需要的 這個營養了 so Patrick coming back to the point here the hay part yes that you mentioned hay this is for animals right this is like animal food 嗯哼
(04:04~05:04) ok this is not hay for us to sleep on or sleep in not quite it's for the animals yeah exactly they need the nutrition from the hay yeah there we go so two biggest enemies of hay is number one if it's too dry that it might cause fire yes it might cause fire in the farm that's not what we want or if the weather is too humid 嗯 humid then the hay would get moldy and you can't eat it it's actually poisonous it's same as our food let's say our rice gets moldy we can't eat the rice yes ok 所以我們知道太乾燥太炎熱 或太潮濕對乾草都不好 所以才說它的保存其實不是那麼容易 那我們回到這句諺語 to make hay well the sunshine 在製作乾草的時候 我們要 趁著這個陽光出來的意思 所以這句諺語其實有點在形容 那時候農夫收割完它新鮮的草 要把它製作成乾草的時候 他們會把握陽光普照的日子
(05:04~06:06) 那在太陽底下 將乾草曬乾就有利於後去製作乾草對 然後拿給動物去喫 因此延伸出來就有點像我們成語裡面 就叫大鐵乘著 Ok So to make hay while the sunshine is actually a literal meaning right It's actually as it as the word describes When do you make hay? Please don't do it at night Please don't do it early in the morning Please do it when there is sunshine That's right And most of the farmers do that So this if you if our 15 minutes fan knows anything about farms you would know that when the sun is up what do you do if you're farmer you work hard and you keep working until the sun sets Please who are you? She knows then that's how the farm life is So here for those of us in the city now we don't have to make hay
(06:06~07:06) but we love sunshine though Of course especially in Taipei exactly So what happens in the city when the sun shines you go stand in the park Yeah and you soak up the sun Yeah 尤其是這個天氣比較冷的時候 臺北的太陽是燉了珍貴的一項資產哦 So I want to ask John Have you ever go some farming stuff or go to a farm before any tourism stuff like that Of course Really Well in here's the thing in South Africa most of the farms cannot make hay Because remember I mentioned the last time in South Africa the weather is very very dry Yes So we can make hay quite easily but the grass and all the different type of green pasture that's needed for hay does not grow very well 所以不太容易製作成乾草 No We don't really make hay
(07:06~08:07) you won't see it on the farms Okay And of course the days when haze are popular when you can make hay That's more for special regions where you can farm But most of the time in South Africa There's no hay It's either green or it's brown Oh So in a in a year you are lucky to see green pasture for maybe For a month or so And the rest of the time it's brown Okay I see 那我來問一下John老師 你知道之前這樣聽起來 南非那麼乾燥 那他們主要的農作物是什麼 Oh we can also farm corn Oh corn Yeah We also farm corn Yes Oh And wheat We also have wheat And in certain regions We also have rice Rice That's in the regions where it's more humid And there's more rainfall Okay I bet the rice won't be as delicious as the rice in Taiwan It's actually Indian rice Indian So it's quite longer Yes It looks like jasmine rice from Thailand
(08:07~09:09) It's those longer type rice but Here's the thing We like our rice soft when we cook it Yeah We like our rice soft when we cook it But in that's in Taiwan But in South Africa The Indian rice is for curry So if you have been to some of these Indian restaurants You will notice that their rice Are very very different The koukanyi Much drier Yeah Much drier And longer And also chewy Chewy So when you Yeah When you bite into it It's a little hard Yeah It's not soft like the ones we are used to here in Taiwan 不像臺灣喜歡喫軟飯哦 沒有 But then that's too soft That's way too soft That's like congee rice Okay 好 我們回到這句願意再複習一下 To make hay well the sun shines Yeah Did John You have some example sentence for our audience Yes Right
(09:09~10:10) So to make hay while the sun shines Where can we use it? You can use it this way Here's an example sentence for you I know you are tired But we should finish this project While we have the chance Let's make hay while the sun shines 嗯 Yes So you know your colleague is super tired And this project is really grinding everybody But you encourage your colleague Hey Let's make hay while the sun shines 嗯 把握時間哦 還是要把它做出來 Let's take this chance and try and finish it Let's not waste more time Let's just keep doing it Yes Okay So it's very encouraging Motivating Let's do it now Let's not postpone it any further Don't waste the time Don't waste time Okay So talking about time Time is money right So I've got another example sentence The stock market is going to do very well right now
(10:10~11:10) So it's a good time to invest You should make hay while the sun shines 哦 Time is money Yes 這個股票市場哦 最近可能很火熱 然後把握這個時間好好打鐵撐熱 進行一波投資啦 You gotta invest now Make hay while the sun shines Yes Make hay Well the sun shines 打鐵撐熱把握時間 Okay this is the first idiom of today Yes Now we are going to the second one Right The next one my personal favorite Really? Oh Yes Because it's a little romantic Yes I think it's romantic But it's kind of tricky If you don't really know the idioms You might be confused about the color of this moon Yes Of course Okay 所以我們這個 idiom叫什麼名字呢 So the next idiom for you guys is Once in a blue moon Once in a blue moon
(11:10~12:12) So Patrick let me go on and explain this Right Once twice three times Right So once meaning one time Yes Okay But in this case when we use it once in a blue moon We are saying one time Okay Hmm When a blue moon happens So we got to figure out what is a blue moon Right When do moon get blue Oh對 這個大字面上看到 blue moon就會想說藍月 那什麼時候會出現藍月 We know blue Monday We don't know blue Yeah and we know our emotional is blue Or something like that But yes The blue moon doesn't exactly means the blue stop Right Not like the blue moon Not sadness Okay So if you guys think this is referring to once in a sad moon No no no no No no no no no No no no no no no no no no No no no no no no no no no no no no no no No no no no no no no no no no no no Yeah
(12:12~13:13) But this blue moon is from an actual use description of the moon phase Okay In every month we've got full moon And we got the moon cycles in every month Okay And then in very rare situations 我們會有兩種月的滿月 當這回事發生的時候 我們會說 這是一個月的滿月 或是第二種月的滿月 會叫做 《月的滿月》 如果我們說《月的滿月》 《月的滿月》 《月的滿月》是《月的滿月》 所以我們會跟著《月的滿月》 是 對 所以在《月的滿月》
(13:13~14:15) 他們會有兩種滿月 對 因為這個日期 跟我們在國立農曆上有點不太一樣 按照慣例 我們是每個月都會看到一次滿月 可是日期上是一天一天 而且經過這個靜密的計算 還有我去查的一些資料 因為沒有0.5天 沒有什麼29.5天 什麼這樣子的 有些月份又30天 又些31天 那 精算之後呢 滿月 大概是每29天 左右會發生一次 因此偶爾 這個就是 可能最大公倍數還是什麼之類的 算出來之後呢 一個月內 就會出現兩次的滿月 那根據這個 國際太空總署 NASA的統計跟計算 NASA Yes, NASA 他們 kind of calculated 他們說 大約 每兩年半 就會發生一次 Blue Moon的現象 OK hang on here ok, Tric 每兩年半 我們有機會 看到Blue Moon 那也就是說 第二次Blue Moon in a month
(14:15~15:17) 那不太難看 每兩年半 所以在你的生日期間 你會有兩次Blue Moon 我覺得 還是蠻難看的 因為你不會一直去注意這件事情 可能是十年久了 You forget 像上一次如果跟大家講 2020年的時候 曾經出現過藍月 Blue Moon的現象 可能不是太多人會知道 Also So when we calculated 2.5 years after 2020 也就代表今年2023年 喔,這個 NASA有統計 今年的8月底 There will be a Blue Moon on the sky Very interesting stuff So this year is the year of the Blue Moon Yeah, the Blue Moon year And it's gonna happen in August Yes, August Or maybe like August 30 Or even go to the September I don't know the Exactly time Yeah, we will see OK Very interesting Yeah So I think in August Patrick We need to come back and revisit this medium
(15:17~16:18) Did you see the Blue Moon? Yes, that's right 好,我們剛剛講的 Once in a Blue Moon 它的意思呢 就像剛剛教授講 它其實想一個 Rare很少見很罕見的狀況 Yes 那這個用法就是對應到了 我們其實中文呢 也有一個成語叫做 鐵樹開花 那鐵樹這個字幕 它其實開花的這個週期 跟這個Blue Moon有點像 都是可能要隔個兩三年 Oh really? Yeah They will still have like 2 or 3 years they will blossom But not every year or every month So we have to wait 就是像是一個比較少見 難得一見的一個現象 OK, this is the first time I've heard this idiom The Chinese proverb So I mean this is new to me But you know that's interesting to know There are trees that don't really blossom Yeah, they don't blossom so frequently Like year or year But maybe they are like 2 years or 3 years They will blossom Nice OK, so John Is there any example sentence for our listeners? This is quite easy one
(16:18~17:18) Because once in a Blue Moon Referred to something that happens very rarely Right? Yeah So I'm sure you and I You know There are a lot of things that happens very rarely Like a bonus or raise Oh maybe my donate What donation? Yes Or climbing up the Apple Podcast charts Oh yes that's not That happens once in a Blue Moon You will reach top 10 On the Apple Podcast charts I hope there will be listed maybe Maybe in August Oh really? Maybe in August For both of us OK So here's an example sentence for you guys I only see my old college friends Once in a Blue Moon Since we all live in different parts of the country now Oh That's quite sad Yeah, well this is a common one today As you grow older
(17:18~18:22) As you start dating and have families So on and so forth You only get to see your old college friends Once in a Blue Moon 嗯 但是換一個角度想好處是 我們現在通訊中發達 You get Line Instagram or Facebook You still have to keep connections on the internet So I won't Patrick that's that's what people are right People are lazy So even with Line and FaceTime People don't FaceTime each other every day Oh of course not Right So when was your last college classmate reunion Oh It was quite coincidence You know that last week I just went You had a reunion last week Yeah 我們上上個禮拜才一羣人去北海岸 就是爬山啊然後去看風景 Nice Yeah You bunch of friends went mountain climbing there Yes Very very nice So you see Don't meet your college friends once in a Blue Moon Meet them more frequently Fantastic And the next example sentence for you guys Is about food
(18:22~19:24) I don't usually go out to eat at fancy restaurants But I decided to treat myself once in a Blue Moon Of course That's very important You got to treat yourself Even if it's once in a Blue Moon Okay Is there any other example sentence Yes one last one Okay The weather What if this weather was terrible Like like this winter that we just had It was one of the longer and colder winters I must say Yes So here's one for like let's say If we have snowstorms Okay The last time we had a snowstorm like this Was once in a Blue Moon over a decade ago Oh 上次遇到這樣的暴風雪天氣已經是十多年前了 Yeah So once in a Blue Moon Oh 暴風雪 The storm is terrible Yes But this year we were very lucky right You know Also once in a Blue Moon We would have snow In the lower altitudes of Taiwan Yeah Most of the time you don't have
(19:24~20:24) You have to go high up in the mountains to get snow This year we were lucky 對 Yummy mountain had snow 對呀今天的冬天稍微冷一點 結果這個海拔比較低的一些地方就有下去了 Yeah But there's something very serious is that We don't rain much this winter And the spring is still not raining Okay So Patrick I have a word challenge for you So if it doesn't rain If it rains too much We will have flood right Yes flood So what about the opposite When it's too dry What will we have I don't I don't I don't know It's called drought A drought Oh yes It's called a drought So here now in the southern parts of A central in southern parts of Taiwan We have a drought problem Yeah 我現在會擔心未來會不會有缺水的問題哦 嗯嗯 所以我們現在要祈禱 We Taiwan can have rain I think it's coming I mean You know I just feel You know it's getting windy
(20:24~21:24) But it should come Yes You know we are very lucky We are blessed people So it will come Don't worry Yes we just got to make sure we don't waste our water Yes The day to day 除了求水之外 我們自己要做生水的東西哦 然後在清明節 清明時節雨紛紛 所以未來可能這個春雨很快就會到了 For sure Ok So we'll go to the third one Yes The third idioms The third idiom is written in the stars written in the stars 這個 Is there still another romantic idioms I think This is pretty romantic if you use it right Ok So let's talk about stars Patrick I think people when we think about stars What comes to mind The first thing is your horoscope Your star sign Right star sign 新做的部分 Yes So what do we care about a star sign Why I want to like Pick the future of our life
(21:24~22:27) There we go We love for each other We want to know who we are We want to know why we behave this way Yes Why I'm feeling this way So I go look at my horoscope I look at my star sign and say Ok month of March Hmm right Is it my lucky month Or is it my unlucky month Yes Ok So star signs come from the stars Right The alignment of all the stars Hmm Ok And obviously this is I would say big data science from way back Yeah 大數據的統計出來的一個結果了 Yes So stars are cute stars are romantic But this star here written in the stars We are talking about our destiny Oh destiny Right Being influenced You know in terms of fortune telling Our futures Yes So if something is written in the stars You look up in the sky and it's written in the stars Then you know the stars align
(22:27~23:28) And you will be the king of the world Wow You know that's how the ancient stories are Yeah Or maybe some fairy tales Yes fairy tales too Ok So it's written in the stars It also means that You know the stars agree with you and they align And of course You know your destiny was Has been prewritten Ok 所以其實換句話說中世紀也如今剛剛講的 很喜歡看星座啊關心 沾心這些占卜的神祕學哦 那written in the stars 寫在星星裡面的東西 就會讓人聯想到這個 欸關心像夜關清像 虧泰命運的感覺 所以在延伸出來 written in the stars 有點像是在心哦 命中註定的事情 So it's about destiny astrology the sky the stars Yeah講到命運 Ok so We have to say 那講到星星的話 The first thing that come to my mind is a song A song

(25:31~26:31) 但他實際上的原曲 The melody of his original country is from French from France Yeah the France I'm sorry French Not America No no no Oh I'm so wrong 對他是一首法國的童謠 那他18世紀的時候就出現了 所以歌曲先出來 纔有這個英國女生去填詞 Ok So This song is kind of quite similar Oh you have to say exactly the same with the alphabet song A B C D E F G Twinkle twinkle little star It's exactly the same Oh it's based on the same melody Yes the same melody And there's another song I don't I wonder John have ever listened to before It's like Baba black sheep Have you any wolves Yes this is very British This I know Oh Baba black sheep Yes you know why I know this Because when I was in elementary school

(28:34~29:34) And faced many obstacles I know that our love is written in the stars Wow Ok imagine that You know your love we were meant to be Because our love was written in the stars If you look up the sky God made stars and God made us to be together Ok what about other situations For example the next one The success of their business seemed to be written in the stars As every decision they made seemed to lead them closer to their goals Oh 他們的成功是命中註定 Yes So for example Elon Musk right The success of Tesla seems to be written in the stars Because Elon Musk already knew This is the future of mankind Yes Alright so one more for you guys Ok
