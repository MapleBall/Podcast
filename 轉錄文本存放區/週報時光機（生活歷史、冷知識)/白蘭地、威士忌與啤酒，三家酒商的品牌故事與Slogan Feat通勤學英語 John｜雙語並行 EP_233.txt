(01:08~02:08) 新的單元、新的氣象,我們做了一個新的頻道名字叫做英語時光機 沒錯,因為我們過去叫 vocab 其實就是主要是好像講很多詞彙或什麼的 可是其實有沒有大家可能有聽到,也發現說 我跟 Patrick 老師其實我們從國際時事、從品牌、從 EDM 啊 我們 cover a lot of stuff, not just the trivia, general knowledge and vocabulary 我們 cover a whole lot more than that, so guys, we have rebranded this particular episode and moving forward, we will be calling it the Wednesday show The 15 Means Cafe,英語咖啡館 Yes, so every Wednesday, join us So back to today's episode, the show with me and Patrick 所以今天我們再又回到我們的英語時光機 那以後我們就訂掉這個單元叫英語時光機 為什麼呢?因為是通勤學英語,featuring週報時光機
(02:08~03:10) Yes, that's right 其實我們之前 Patrick 我們還有想過很多很多其他的名字 Like JP Talk, JP Studio,就是從 JP 這樣子 Because it was PJ,right? But with PJ, it sounds more like pajamas So we didn't want people to think we are wearing our pajamas and recording these episodes So we ended up with JP Time Let's keep it simple Yeah, but somebody will think about JP Time represent Japan But the truth is we're not talking about Japanese or Japanese culture You know what? If it's Japanese culture, we will call it Nippon Time Hey, not JP Time Nippon Time Ok, JP stands for John and Patrick John and Patrick So thank you for joining us on this whole rebranded episode And moving forward Patrick, we are going to be talking about again
(03:10~04:12) Famous brands around the world that we actually see all the time Yes, exactly We have to say the time that we are recording right now is the last holiday of Double Ten holiday,right? Yeah, we are going to cry the last day So we need some alcohol 因為讓我們心情比較放鬆一點 去面對明天收假的心情 So today we are talking about three alcohol brands Three famous alcohol brands or actually Patrick, we should be calling it If we say alcohol, then it's a generic term for every type of alcohol Right? But you know this is for tasting This is for quality of life This is for you know, fancy lifestyle So we should call it wine and spirits It's more high class, high level stuff Ok, right So we're going to be covering three interesting and important wine and spirits brands
(04:12~05:13) that you guys have seen and probably have tasted in your life But as you guys know, I can't handle my liquor So I can't drink So I'm sorry, I know these brands, I've seen them You know, I have sent them as gifts before But never have I drank them and tasted them So I'm allergic to alcohol, I'm afraid Ok, that sounds sad 有些人是主張一輩子要藏一點酒精的 But we still have to say 還是要跟大家呼籲一下 這個未成年是情物飲酒 And don't drive after you drink, right? 這個也是最後不要開車的 非常重要的一件事情 So with everything that has to do with wine and spirit advertising There should be a warning message, right? Don't drink and drive Yes, that's very important And not sold to people who are under 18 years old I've saw the slogan, they say Please do not drink if you are a minor
(05:13~06:13) Is that a way to say that? Yes, because if you are under 18 years of age Legally, under legal framework You are considered a minor But because you are over 18 years of age Doesn't mean you are a major Ok, it's the wrong word Minor means small Ok, so you are a minor in the legal framework Ok, but people who are over 18 years of age Who can sign for themselves And be legally responsible for themselves Are adults Adults, ok So minors and adults Not minors and majors No Ok,所以就補充到一個知識 So we are talking about three I would say wine and spirits brand, right? Yes The first one is called Hennessey Hennessey Today's first one 這個中文好像叫宣尼斯 Ok, so this brand They are famous about their cognac
(06:13~07:14) 幹易白蘭地 This kind of brand 簡單的跟大家介紹一下 這個宣尼斯這個品牌 它其實已經有250年以上的歷史了 打從西元1765年開始 是有一位愛爾蘭的退役軍人 剛好就跟這個品牌的名字一樣 它叫做Richard Hennessey Hennessey Yes,它成立了一個釀酒廠 那在它的軍女生涯之後 它就前往這個法國的西部 一個名為幹易的地區去釀製 所謂的白蘭地 後來呢 還找到了它的這個 他們家族當中非常重要的一個合作的 另外一個家族叫做Jean Filiu 找到這個樣的一個首席調酒師 來幫助他們的Hennessey這個品牌 然後兩個家族的關係 這個合作的關係 從當時250年開創以來 到現在一直維持這樣的家族的互惠的合作 所以是家業的 所以看看 如何人們在當天的日子中 名字的公司 對嗎
(07:14~08:14) 所以是Hennessey和孫兒 他兒子 OK 或是James Hennessey和公司 指的是 兒子 James Hennessey 已經完成了 對 嗯 Yes OK 這就是這個兩個家族 然後找到他們的特調酒師 這叫一直合作下去 其實從1765年到1840年的時候 其實Hennessey已經是 a very famous world brand of making cognac OK So what kind of 白蘭地 will call it cognac 啊 這他其實是有一個專有名詞叫 幹易白蘭地的 Yes OK 那他呢 其實在歐洲啊 有非常嚴格的法規規定 他其實要按照一定相關的標準流程去製造 才能達到出這樣的酒款 So similarly this is what the French does right Patrick You cannot call something that is sparkling that's got bubbles and wine You can't call it champagne It has to be brewed
(08:14~09:15) It has to be distilled and processed in the champagne region to be called champagne Yeah And above and beyond all that If you want to make champagne You have to go through their national standards 嗯 You have to follow their tradition You have to follow their way of making champagne Alright So similarly to cognac It's the same thing If the cognac region Uh The the produce is from cognac region Yes So if it's from anywhere else It's just brandy But if it's from cognac region It's can be considered cognac Plus you have to go through A lot of the local processes and licensing and testing and labeling 嗯 Exactly Colored cognac 嗯 對這個 cognac酒呢 其實第一個非常嚴格的規定 就是你的葡萄品種 就一定要來自這個地區 那再加上其實很多的嚴格規範哦 包含他的製造的流程到他怎麼釀製的 其實都有一套 呃嚴格的法規去規定
(09:15~10:15) 那如果你打造的過程當中不符合這樣的 sop 但你又把自己的酒命名為 cognac 其實是會觸犯歐洲當地的法律 So similarly we should do it for our 烏龍蝶 in Alimountain right You know Alimountain 烏龍蝶 You can't call it Alimountain 烏龍蝶 If it's not from Alimountain Yeah You have to use their lead from the Alishan right Yeah But most people don't do that They you know They sort of copy and paste the labels And then pretend they are from Alimountain So we need to do something like this We also need to set up some standards And you know Make the labels well known So it becomes a national brand Yes I learned about that a lot of European Not only French but also Italian They're making their pizzas They also have their rules right Yes So it's kind of 他們很注重他們的一個食物的文化 And you have to take care of their 一定要照他們的流程 才能稱作是他們家的食物這種感覺 So okay let's go back to Hennesse There's a website called Satista 史蒂斯塔 他們統計過其實2020年這個Hennesse
(10:15~11:16) 他們有這個九公升樁的這個Coneeco 當初就賣出了八百萬響 Nine liters that's a big bottle Yeah it's a big bottle That's a big bottle When everyone were drunk if you have to drink like nine liters a day or something Yeah Hennesse was the leading brand of Coneeco in the world In 2022 Oh for sure Oh for sure You know if you travel around the world in most of the airports Hennesse also does a lot of very very fancy marketing They are in all the fancy airports So let's say if you would transit to somewhere in Hong Kong Or in Shanghai or even in Taoyuan Airport Yes You would see a beautiful bottle of Hennesse in the middle of the walkway Right And then you would admire it like an art piece You think that is so luxury Yes And it makes me feel like I can't afford the wine
(11:16~12:17) Yes you don't drink it It's something you don't drink you admire it Yes If you own it it's like owning a BMW It's a status symbol 嗯 ok So if you're talking about the wine We'll say about their age statement Right 這個年份的部分存了多久 那當然在Hennesse的規範裡面 其實他們對於他們這個Connect 也有類似的這樣年份的規範 那有不同的等級 譬如說我們非常熟悉的XO 或者是VS或者是VSOP 不同的簡寫 他們代表的是不同意思 例如說XO是ExtraOde 在木桶內已經成放了十年以上的 這種高級的年份的白蘭地久 才能被稱作叫做XO So if you buy some Hennesse They'll say a Cognac XO Or Hennesse VS 這個是不同等級的酒 酒款啊 所以當然存放的年份越久 這個價格就會越高 That's right And obviously for people like us Patrick
(12:17~13:19) We would just go to the liquor store and say Hey give me the most expensive bottle Right Okay We wouldn't read the label and say Oh what's the difference between VS VSOP and XO So from young my father He went on business trips He would try and buy and source these You know the more discounted bottles of extra old XOs Oh Hennesse XOs from Hong Kong Or from Singapore when he went on business trips You know why Because back in Taiwan When you are invited to dinner Oh to dine with your clients Yes Then you bring a bottle of XO Ah You know that lightens up the mood And makes doing business a lot easier 這個看到XO就覺得哇 這個是老江湖的董喝的感覺 Okay So I would like to ask John Do you know
(13:19~14:19) Which group of the company owned Hennesse Okay My understanding goes back to Hennesse As a standalone independent company So Hennesse was a family business So in wine and spirit companies or groups They were sort of the odd one out for a long long time Yes Until Until They became the biggest Luxury brand and part of the luxury groups Okay Which is the LVMH Ah yes Alright Okay And you know how I knew about this Because one day I read an announcement about LVMH LV being calling or renaming the group LVMH And then I'm like what's the M and what's the H Hmm right We know LV So who's M who's H And following the naming patterns of company registrations We all know
(14:19~15:20) It's either brands that put together or it's like LV and son Ah yes Or LV and partner kind of idea Yeah the partner So I was curious about what is the M and H Is it another two names of like two big rich dudes Or is it two family names And voilà Hmm It's Moe Okay the champagne brand Yes And Hennesse Yes For the H So LV with Moe and Hennesse LVMH Yes 對沒錯 這個教授已經講完了沒有錯 這個Hennesse呢 其實是在1987年被這個LVMH集團給併購 成為這個LVMH當中的H的這個代表 那剛剛一直講到的 Moe是這個法國的知名品牌香檳酒 是這個叫明月香檳 當初也是 That's right 應該也有快250年歷史的一個品牌了 這也是老品牌了 那都是在法國非常有名的酒類 所以這兩個呢就跟LV
(15:20~16:20) 合併成的LVMH集團 那當然除了這四個品牌之外還有像 Dior 或者是Tiffani 都是這個LVMH旗下非常有名的牌子 Tiffani is a recent acquisition Yes Okay 所以你看這個車子品牌不停的擴大當中 非常的厲害 Okay so talk about all the Hennesse We still didn't speak about their slogans right What is this slogan? Yes I prepared two slogans One is from the 1962 1962 It's a quite old one But I think it's very classic They say it's the name that means most in brandy Okay so 1962 slogan of Hennesse was It's the name that means the most in brandy Oh meaning the name is more important than the brandy Okay Make sense Hennesse okay It means all about the brandy right So I guess in a way you can also agree
(16:20~17:20) I think most people even if you don't know what cognac is Whether it's a brandy or whiskey or whatever it is When you see Hennesse you know it's a It's a spirit It's a hard liquor and it's a luxury brand It's a luxury liquor So Hennesse I think in a way It is more important than cognac Almost If you can say that right Most people would check the cognac But actually I think Hennesse the brand name is bigger than cognac Yeah it's almost become a lifestyle right You drink Hennesse for like It makes your life status more higher or something Oh yeah and they do a lot of parties Cool parties I have to tell you Okay okay I say I prepared two slogans Another one The another one Okay 這個最近其實8月的時候 Hennesse有拍了一支微電影 是這個奧斯卡金像獎的電影製作人 The director who produced the whiplash and La La Land Oh yes
(17:20~18:23) I forgot his name like Damiyan I only remember this one Damian Yeah Damian Damian something Yes Okay他就是把邀請到了這個 Damiyan導演 來幫這個Hennesse拍了一支新的微電 那他這一支微電影面就有一個新的 slogan 叫做life is an Odyssey Life is an Odyssey So Odyssey is like a fantasy adventure kind of idea And Odyssey can also mean a long journey Okay這個其實就是之前古希臘非常重要 兩部史詩之一嘛 所以就在講說這個人生當中有很多 不管是奇幻的喜怒哀樂的這種感覺 那當然在微電影過程當中 為了要串接這個 slogan 起來 其實在微電影面就 很多的人生重要的場景裡面 都可以看到一瓶Hennesse的 cognac 串連了 然後就跟這個 slogan 做了一個結合 So it's it's part of your life now If you want a good life you have to go with Hennesse Yeah exactly So you see
(18:23~19:23) 1962 they talk about that they mean the most in brandy But now this is the part of your life right Okay So it's just a Hennesse的介紹 Wow So I suppose people today are rich enough to drink Hennesse Yeah Yeah this is a kind of point of view right 以前的人可能覺得哇這個買起 brandy就已經很厲害了 但是現在人 How much would a bottle of XO cost back in the day right And today it's like A lot of people can buy one right It's not so expensive anymore Well we can put it on the credit card Okay Yeah Yeah see a part If you can't afford it you put it on the card But a long time ago you don't have a credit card Yeah you have to take off the cash Like my grandpa's time Yeah my grandpa's time You know Chinese New Year That's the only time you would buy alcohol right Ah okay So we'll go to the second wine brand The one that is very very famous And maybe some of the listeners 前一段時間我跟John老師的這個Podcast都有被這家酒類投到廣告
(19:23~20:25) It's the Johnny Walker Yes It's me walking with a Walker Yeah you're John right Yeah Okay So let me talk about this brand Go ahead 它其實也是200年的老品牌的 Yes Sugarland Scott Scottish brand 它成立於1820年哦 那創辦人 His name is John Walker John Walker Yeah 他年輕的時候呢 其實家裡是這個做農產的哦 就是農家子弟 那後來他把他們家族的農場給賣掉 改成去經營一個雜貨店為生 Grocery store That's what I remember it as Okay 然後到了1823年的時候呢 因為剛好遇到這個英國政府當時修改他們的這個稅法 他們放寬了這個去經營酒廠的這個營業許可 所以呢John Walker也在他的店內開始翻賣9款 後來他甚至就選中了這個Whiskey 去當眾他們這個雜貨店內的主力商品 And if you think about it
(20:25~21:27) When we talk about Johnny Walker being a 200 year old Scottish brand So you know when we talk about Scotland We don't think about champagne We don't think about cognac Yes We think about Scotch Or Scottish whisky Yes 這個蘇格蘭威士忌 That's right 沒錯 Okay 所以這個就跟Hannis不同哦 這個John Walker他的主力產品就像剛剛John老師講的 這是這個蘇格蘭威士忌 那其實稍微的科普一下 其實在威士忌上面會分成 只用麥芽釀製的叫做單一麥芽威士忌 那如果用可能其他古類的像玉米啊 或裸麥 然後參雜不同的配料叫做古物威士忌 Yes 那另外還有一種是將單一麥芽跟古物威士忌 融合在一起的調和威士忌 那Johnny Walker他們最厲害的地方就是在他們的調和威士忌 在世界上是非常非常知名的 Yes 後來呢這個Johnny Walker的 酒也賣得越來越好 那他就以這個自己的名字John Walker 去取了這個這個品牌的名字 那Johnny Walker就誕生了
(21:27~22:28) Do you ever take a good look at their bottle about Johnny Walker's wine Ok 嗯 So something about Johnny Walker that is different That stands out with all the other brands is the first of all They only have their blue The green and their black label That's it. They call it Johnny Walker blue label Johnny Walker black label Johnny Walker green label and Do they care about single malt or double malt or whatever You put in it. No It's the Johnny Walker flavor It's the green label It's the blue label And it's the black label Yes Just in不同的標籤 去分辨他們的這個 品中裝的這個威士忌是什麼樣不同的感覺 That's right So it stands out. It's easy to understand. I think for consumers You know you just pick your color Even kids can do that And most importantly They also stand out with their shape of the bottle
(22:28~23:30) Oh yes 他們是方形的評審 他當時為什麼會設計這個方形評審 也跟大家補充一下 就是當時這個因為 以前在運送這些酒類的時候都是用火車 可能裝箱去這個運送的嘛 那火車鐵軌會咳咳咳咳 那有可能在碰撞的過程不小心就把 酒給打破了 那Johnny Walker的這個當時他們的這個 團隊就想到說啊 那我們設計這個方形評審可能比起圓桶的 比較耐撞 所以才改成這個方形評審去設計 那之後他們就搭上剛剛 John老師有提到這個商標 分成不同顏色 而且以他們最標誌的 傾斜24度角的商標 來去區分不同的口感啊味道跟酒精濃度 ok so about Johnny Walker's slogan it's very cool he has never changed their slogan right the slogan is called keep walking I think they've never changed or deviated from that it's always been keep walking so yeah it's
(23:30~24:32) it's very active it means you know you're moving on and it means you're very forward thinking right you never look back you have no regrets keep walking 我覺得這個 slogan 其實真的取得很好 就像他們的品牌叫Johnny Walker 你想要keep walking Johnny is really walking and walking and walking like walk for 200 years well technically the logo the logo does look like a slim gentleman moving ah yes he is looking like he's walking with a walker so yeah yeah I think it all ties in with a brand and a logo and also from a lifestyle perspective lifestyle you know keep walking don't turn back you know look forward 真的是取得很好難怪這 這麼多年來都沒有換過他們的 slogan ok and I have something to add quickly Patrick ok you know the label that you're talking about on the outside or on the bottom it's a slanted label
(24:32~25:32) it's slanted it's not square usually the labels are oval or squared that's that's pasted all around but Johnny Walker's label is slanted and apparently what I found was apparently that was their way of differentiating between the copies the counterfeit whiskey's to Johnny Walker 嗯ok 透過這個商標去 杜絕人家去抄襲他的這個評審啦 so don't worry guys when you go by your Johnny Walker you know when it's sort of at an angle if you look at the log you know the sticker it's at an angle they did that for yeah for good reason ok so this is the second brand Johnny Walker ok so the last one i will first one for today yeah i will first read his slogan in Chinese everyone will know the brand 嗯 the slogan is 就是要害你根
(25:32~26:34) 啊ok hannigan yeah hannigan 這個真的在廣告上面看到都爛掉 大家都會知道他的 slogan hannigan yes ok so how can we translate 就是要害你根 into English i think it reads it can only be hannigan right yes and i remember this commercial was very very similar to what we saw recently with nespresso long long time ago i remember growing up you know most of the commercials with would have this happy party mood vibe going people are happy and everything and then this guy go grabs a bottle of beer right a beer bottle and you know he picks it up and it's not a hannigan and he's digging for hannigan and then his friend was digging in another ice cabinet for hannigan right and he found hannigan and he took a sip and his friend says hey it can only be hannigan yeah that means people should only drink hannigan
(26:34~27:34) and the one you mentioned about nespresso it makes me come up the mind of george conloni yes he said about nespresso what else right is this kind of a same nespresso what else yeah same idea same idea about the the brand so nespresso in terms of marketing and commercials and hannigan they are all classic marketing material if you want to learn anything about advertising and marketing you know hannigan and nespresso you wouldn't go wrong yeah they are very strong about marketing stuff very very good marketing do you know where where hannigan come from which country of course hannigan right hannigan comes from neverland's holland 對這個何蘭的牌子 當然 他們有像前面兩個已經有兩百多年 他大概是成立於1864年的品牌 也有一百五十年以上的歷史了 那當初是在這個創辦人叫 hannigan 他他有一個名字叫 hannigan 然後 it's all named after their surname it's cool right they like to name their the brand
(27:34~28:34) by their names ok 他是在這個 何蘭的阿姆斯特丹的一間啤酒廠 他先把這個地方給賣下來了 後來呢這個啤酒工廠越住越大 他甚至找來了專業的團隊 幫他的工廠去研發這些專業的效果 後來 甚至在這個巴黎的世界博覽會的 broad expo 他們還獲得了獎 這個獲獎 成為了一個非常全球知名的啤酒品牌 but i have to say now knowing hannigan being such an old brewery i you know i would assume hannigan you know from growing up seeing all the commercials hannigan is a very young brand to be honest very hip very young very cool they don't sell that oldness right when you drink hannigan it's not about oh you know i'm an old guy you know i went to war and i drink beer and i drink hannigan nothing like that they always look very hip so it's interesting to see you know this old brewery really doing marketing to
(28:34~29:36) make them look always hip and cool 嗯真的真的是在我有觀察到就是 hannigan的啤酒類型啊不要說 就是光以他們的產品 是不斷是有在推陳出新的一個狀況 所以當時美國的禁酒令結束了 這個 hannigan也很快順勢的 就打進了美國的市場 然後在之後呢甚至 hannigan 直接霸佔了美國的啤酒市場 對所以 hannigan在美國市場是非常非常受到歡迎的 嗯這個 hannigan呢其實在全球的啤酒市場 這個他的規模啊也是第二大 僅次於另外一個非常有名的 這個啤酒品牌叫做百威 百威啤酒是 yeah but wiser is the biggest beer seller in the around world yeah yeah 但是 hannigan是排名第二 那他現在其實據點已經擴張到70個國家左右 而且全球有超過160個 這個啤酒廠都是來自於 hannigan的 而且是他一路這樣
(29:36~30:37) 不斷的並購並購纔到這個間的這個規模 yes yeah wow okay and i remember recently i can't remember maybe it was a year or two ago i saw hannigan trying to do something different 嗯 they are offering now apparently you can drink a zero out percent alcohol ah hannigan 嗯 they sold that for some odd reason i thought people in the west won't like it apparently it was a big hit 嗯 in japan ah people like it yeah people thought it was kind of cool yeah people like that flavor people like the texture in their mouth without any percentage of alcohol you know during the pandemic time 這個很多的啤酒商其實他們的銷量都講了 因為 we don't have a lot of party during the pandemic times right yeah but hannigan 他們是少數在這段時間業績還不斷的成長的 因為原因就是我其實有看過一篇報導 是在訪問這個 hannigan的這個銷售的
(30:37~31:38) 原因的總裁他們在 講他們公司當時在面對這個疫情的時候 其實有一個部分就是在那段期間 他們推出了各種不同的產品 就像剛剛這個教老師提到的這個五酒精啤酒 或者是冰釀類型的啤酒 或者是這個可能 呃女性朋友會比較喜歡的苦味比較低的 排白啤酒啊這種多樣性的產品 在公佔世界上各個地方的這個市場 當中呢當然也含了這個臺灣啤酒的市場 那其實在這段過程當中不斷的去嘗試嘗試 後來就鎖定到他的客羣這段銷量 也慢慢的就沒有受到疫情的影響 甚至還逆勢的成長 yes so do they have slogans for different product line then oh yes it seems like they broaden it 嗯 they don't only offer the light beers they offer the the more strong beers and then offer the fruity beers and then offer the non alcohol beers I mean it's it's a wide variety
(31:38~32:38) yeah ok for example the non alcohol beer they get a slogan like it's called cheers with no alcohol now you can cheers with no alcohol now you can oh means you can now do cheers and drink without any alcohol 啊 yes 嗯 隨時要乾杯都可以 就算你沒有就今年無所謂那種感覺 they still have a commercial for this non alcohol beer I can find it on youtube 那這個國外的影片 you can have all these parties and cheers and you don't have to consume alcohol 嗯 interesting you don't have to be drunk you don't have to drown so it sounds like something for me oh yeah 0% alcohol good for me yes ok so 我們知道這個海泥跟非常經典的是就是要海泥 yes but the truth is this is a very old slogan yes yeah
(32:38~33:41) 但是他們最近有一個新的 they call it for a fresher world oh for a fresher world so fresh refreshing a fresh taste 嗯 yes right to lighten up the mood for a fresh taste ok for a fresher world 對這個中文叫做讓世界幻染意識 他一直用不同的這種 創意的表達方式 然後也用一種比較開放的心態 去面對現在市場上的變化 然後提供你更好的生活品味 that's right be friendly be fresh be cool be new to you and you know you can have a good time with hennigan yeah exactly ok this is the introduce of hennigan wow ok so that's the three for today the first one hennesey it's the name that means most in brandy in nineteen sixty two and now hennesey is life is an odyssey alright and the second brand we talked about today
(33:41~34:43) Johnny Walker with its blue label black label green label red labels and the slogan is to keep walking keep walking and the third brand today hennigan we just mentioned the biggest and the most popular slogan the most memorable slogan to be honest it can only be hennigan and of course the new new one after the pandemic for a fresher world drink hennigan for a fresher world so like we mentioned earlier patrick yes although we are not promoting drinking we are promoting responsible drinking alright if you have to drink think about all these brands and there are lots of brands marketing and slogans to be learned yeah ok so when you drink don't just make it a drinking thing right don't just drink read the label alright ok so i will have to ask john if today you're not allergic to the alcohol stuff
(34:43~35:44) yeah these three brands which one will you choose to taste if i'm not allergic to any alcohol at all which of these three brands would i taste i'm sorry i would taste all three oh yeah they are the top brands in the world i mean i would be silly not to drink and taste all of them and to figure out what i like and don't like oh right it's like chocolate so many chocolate brands but you gotta taste them all to figure out which one is your favorite hmm yeah i agree with you that's the beauty of the world today yeah you have to taste it yeah you have to taste it so i can't pick and choose you know because we chose a cognac and we chose a whiskey brand and then we chose a beer brand yeah so i mean yeah these are three big big big categories that i you know just for beer i think i would have to taste one beer every day to figure out what i like oh yeah right and then whiskey maybe there are 20 30 brands that i have to sample
(35:44~36:44) before i understand anything and then brandy brandies i don't know maybe 40 to 50 hmm because we've got cognacs and brandies yeah you know so many brands to actually sample ok ok so the same questions for the 15 mains fans and yeah 周寶石光基的 這個聽眾朋友們 these three brands i have to change my my questions to these three brands which one will want it to taste the most yeah 哪一個品牌是你最想喝的 so 15 mains fam and also our friends from周寶石光基 please do tell us down below using the comment link why don't you tell us out of these three brands which do you like the most and which do you drink actually the most alright oh and which one would you recommend us you know if if one of these days you know i i fix myself up how i don't know how but i mean if i'm not allergic to alcohol maybe i'll go sample it you know so leave us comment and let us know
