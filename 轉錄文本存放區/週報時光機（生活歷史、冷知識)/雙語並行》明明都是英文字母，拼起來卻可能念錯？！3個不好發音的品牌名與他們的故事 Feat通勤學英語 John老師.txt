(02:02~03:03) You have something different That's right Than what we did before Previously we did idioms And their origin stories And their you know Maybe history about certain idioms And then with originated so on and so forth But today I'm reading the prepped work Yes It's a little different Yes it's quite different We are talking about idioms before But today You know that my show 周報時光機 Talk about a lot of brand story So you know a lot of brand story We'll have to pronounce their brand's name Yes But some of the brand Their name is hard to pronounce Somebody they use English And you talk to the foreigner But you don't know how to pronounce it Maybe they'll be confused Which brand are you talking about Let's put it this way If you go to Sogo on anniversary sale Sometimes you go to the food court You listen to people And you hear actually a lot of brand names
(03:03~04:03) When they talk Yes When people shop Everything is a brand Everything is a brand And people you know But to me I can sort of tell Like if the person knows the brand Or not knows the brand Kinda And obviously we all know That some brands are not 100% English So what is the pronunciation Yes that's right So this is our topic today 我們今天呢 就是要來跟大家介紹一些品牌故事 那當然結合英文的部分 我們都知道有些品牌的名稱 他看起來雖然都是英文字母組成起來的 但你要念還真的是念不出來 Exactly 我們今天舉了三個 這個很有名的牌子 都是世界知名的牌子 那來跟大家分享 他的品牌故事 以及他的英文的念法 Fantastic So we are going to start Going back to the basics To your daily life During the week Going to food courts How do you pronounce The restaurants that you love How do you pronounce The brands that you love
(04:03~05:03) Yes that's right Ok three brands 我覺得還有一個部分是 我們在介紹的時候 同時呢這一集 You can know his pronunciation And also know some of his back stories Exactly I think the back stories are the most interesting from you You know contribution from your side And obviously you know I will bring in a little bit of My viewpoint in the player Ok Ok So today's first brand I have to say today's brand is almost It's all luxury brands Ah we love luxury brands Don't we Maybe the luxury brands They have a very difficult pronunciation To make them more complicated And more high level Maybe like that So maybe Patrick You and I we should change names Into like maybe a French or Italian name To make it sound fancy Really but I'm scared that If I change my name I don't know how to pronounce it No your mom won't know how to pronounce it Oh it will become like Chinglish or something Yes
(05:03~06:06) Ok let's go to the first brand of today Right 先跟大家介紹一下 這個品牌呢 他是賣巧克力的 chocolate Ok favorite So John Which kind of chocolate brand You think that is high class Or maybe a kind of luxury brands of chocolate Luxury brand of chocolate In Taiwan It has to be Godiva It has to be Godiva Because you know Luxury brand chocolate Valentine's Day Special occasion chocolate tier You know these are the keywords And you put them all together You get only Godiva As far as I'm concerned There are many brands out there But they're cool They're nice But you know If you give Godiva chocolates As a gift on Valentine's Day You win You win all the time Yes Ok沒錯 我們今天第一個牌子就是 John老師講到的 Godiva My favorite Really My wife's favorite Actually
(06:06~07:07) So I have a question for John We when I learned it from the internet Godiva has another pronunciation like Godiva Is that Where's the differences between this Ok So I also googled this up way back When I first seen this brand Personally The first time that I saw this brand I pronounced it Godiva Ok Why Because DIVA Diva Meaning a goddess Right Yes And there we go So Godiva Ok Sounded right to me But then later on I heard people saying Godiva And I watched a few American TV series And they called it Godiva Oh And I was like Mmm So Who's right I googled it up And to be honest with you Both are correct Oh Why is both correct Because first of all
(07:07~08:08) In Northern America They they pronounce it Godiva Mmm Ok And that's where it got very strong the brand Yes Ok In Europe That's where Godiva started But once they moved to US They became much bigger global brand Mmm Ok So the North American people called it Godiva And I'm ok You know I'm fine with that Yes And then I dug a little bit deeper And then I found that Because it's a Belgian chocolate brand It originated from Belgium British Yeah So They pronounce these words More in English So it will be Godiva Oh Yes Godiva Yes Not Godiva But again In America If you say Godiva Same chocolate brand You go to Europe Maybe Godiva Or in Taiwan Godiva Find not a big problem there Oh I heard more like
(08:08~09:09) Godiva in Taiwan That's like how people would cut up the syllables You know it's like U2B Oh Like you don't put T-U-B-E together You cut T-U-B-E as separate words So it will You sort of read it U And then 2B But actually T-U-B-E is tube Oh yes You have to combine together Yeah Ok Then我們來介紹一下 Godiva這個品牌 其實它的名字起源呢 就像剛剛這個教老師講 它是來自於 British的布魯塞爾的一個 chocolate 品牌 那其實它的名字呢 是來自於一個傳說人物 叫 Lady Godiva Yes Lady Godiva Ok Issa 它是一個神話人物 我們等一下來跟大家介紹一下 這個故事 其實它是在中世紀 英格蘭伯爵的一個妻子 那當時其實百姓的生活 非常的痛苦 他們沒有辦法好好生活 結果這個公爵 還沒有幫助他們 反而還增加了他們的稅收 導致他們的生活就更苦了
(09:09~10:09) 那這個 Lady Godiva呢 他就發揮了他的測影執行 去跟這個他的老公 也就是這個伯爵 希望他可以減免他們的稅收 讓百姓好過一點 那 Godiva 的想法就是 啊 我就是覺得 I'm so poor I don't have money to live 就這樣去跟他的老公請求 可是伯爵呢不答應 他就覺得如果你要他們減稅 You have to be naked and ride a horse and go on the street Ok look You know you gotta do something so I can't you know take away the tax I can reduce the tax So do something outrageous And at that time if you think about it It's outrageous to tell a woman to ride a horse naked It's outrageous It's something that's impossible But for Lady Godiva What did she do? Yeah she became a legend Yeah became a legend How? Because就像剛剛教堯老師講 你要一個女生 騎著馬鑼上身在大街上這樣遊行
(10:09~11:09) 這對女生來講是一個 非常不可能去完成的事情 但是呢 Lady Godiva她覺得 照顧民眾比她自己的這個 這裡的隱私來得更重要 所以她就答應了 她這個伯爵的要求 但是她做了一個這個前置作業 就是告訴所有城裡的百姓說 為了幫你們減稅 那請明天沒有人就關上窗戶 我會裸體騎著馬到大街上遊行 你們就不要偷看 這樣我也可以完成 完成伯爵的任務 那也可以幫助你們減少稅收 也不會有被偷看的問題 最終呢 大家就答應了這個Lady Godiva 那她就真的完成這個繞行 伯爵呢也信守她的承諾 減少了這個稅收 因此就成為了一個 Legendary的 一個Goddess Yeah well The story turned into a legend And of course that legend continued Of this noble woman Who was very selfless in this act Ok but 我在這個故事裡面
(11:09~12:10) 其實我之前在我自己的頻道有 稍微介紹過這個故事 Ok you did Yeah there is another slant Inside the stories called Pippin Tom Ah Pippin Tom Ok yeah what is Pippin Tom Pippin Tom is The name you call a person When that person likes to Peep as in You know check out other people Sneaking behind walls or little holes Having that behavior Can I say That behavior That likes to check out other people You know Sort of violating their privacy Ah偷窺狂 Yeah偷窺狂 Yes and this Peeping Tom this vocabulary It's kind of come from the story Like when Lady Godiva 她在街上遊行的時候 大家都跟她講好說 欸你不要偷看 但是就有一個這個 人叫做Tom 他是一個Taylor 他是裁縫師
(12:10~13:11) Oh Tom the Taylor Yeah he's a pervert Yeah he did the peeping stop 他就他打開了他的這個窗戶 偷看了這個 Lady Godiva裸體的樣子 後來呢 他因為做這件事情 瞬間他雙眼就失明瞭 所以才衍生出了 Pippin Tom這個詞句 Ok He got punished Punished by the goddess Ok 那我們剛剛有講到就是 這個故事可以感覺到 Lady Godiva 他是一個非常慷慨 非常大膽 非常未鳴喉舌的一個角色 那 這是不是 跟他的巧克力的特質有點像呢 教授老師要不要來說明一下 How do you feel about this brand? I you know personally If you don't think about the Lady Godiva's backstory You know you think about If you just look at the brand Because obviously the brand doesn't say Lady Godiva It just says Godiva Right yes
(13:11~14:11) So you will associate some of her qualities With this chocolate Hmm Right So it's well respected People respect Lady Godiva Yes And Lady Godiva is very generous To her people And she is also a very strong character So you see all these qualities Link very nicely to chocolate Yes Chocolate with its strong flavor And you know the size of the chocolate is very generous The flavors are very generous Okay And it's a well respected chocolate store Oh So if you put them together It's a good match Okay So this is our first brand Godiva or Godiva is okay to Yeah pronounced Both okay To be honest both okay Yes But in Belgium If you want to be very precise In Belgium They pronounce it Godiva
(14:11~15:11) Okay 原產地的比利時的布塞爾 They named it Godiva Okay So this is a reference to the second brand This brand is totally a luxury brand It just came from Milan Italy Stuart From Milan So it must be a fashion brand A fashion brand Start with the letter V V The only one is Versace Ah ha That's the only one That seems like you know a lot of luxury brands You go to department stores If you go, you know One day you will know Patrick You know one day you and your girlfriend get married And she goes shopping You know what do you do? You read all the brands You don't know anything But you just read Ah yeah Right you'll be like which store is this Yeah How do you pronounce this PRDA Prayday You have to be foolish Or you maybe have to pay the Pay the money or something Yes
(15:11~16:12) You can't go to Chanel and say Oh you know we went to Chanel Last week right So I was very much educated by my wife about I see That's why you're so kind of know about a lot of luxury brands You have to That's how you make conversation with your wife Happy wife happy life Okay this slogan comes out again Okay So Versace 這個品牌沒有錯 就是我們要講到這個色詞品品牌 他是在1978年義大利米蘭這個地方登場的 Okay 那他的名字呢 其實就來自於他的創辦人叫做 Janney Versace Yes Legendary Design Yes 他也是這個接觸到了服裝設計 本身是因為 他母親之前就是一個裁縫師 據說九歲的時候 這個Janney呢 他就自己設計出了一件藍色的玩禮服 I'm not surprised You know with all the designers even even Alexander Wang and these guys You know from a young age
(16:12~17:12) They show talent They see fashion with a different pair of eyes We do You know we think it's just clothes But for them it's It's you know maybe triangles Maybe it's the shape Maybe it's it's sort of spatial in 3D Yeah So I'm not surprised if Janney That this all by himself when he was nine years old Okay 但是要講到 Versace這個品牌 I would like to ask John Do you know about what kind of style 他搶他主打的品牌的風格 Good question Patrick Honestly I have never worn or never been a big fan or I'm not very educated about Versace But I do know He got shot So he died Not because of natural causes He got shot and he died in 1997 That's how I remember Versace I know it's a brand But in 1997 I remember I was watching the news And I'm like
(17:12~18:12) Oh the founder of Versace died And I'm like Hah I thought it's like a hundred year old brand You know what I mean And on CNN It's it The news was Oh the genius The ever loved Gianni Versace passed away today Been murdered So it was a big case For especially me at that time I was a teenager So it was a shock like Huh A designer getting shot in front of his house That's unheard of That's crazy 啊對 Okay 他這時候 那時候97年的時候 I have to say when 1997 I'm only like three years old So I totally don't know this story But it's okay When I google it I realized this kind of tragedy When he died His sister 他姐姐接手了 Versace繼續 繼續幫助他的這個公司去成長著狀 那
(18:12~19:12) I come back to his style But he's a Versace 他的設計的時候 都用很大膽啊 很鮮豔的色彩 去做他們的一些設計 He's got a fancy logo too doesn't he His logo is something to do with them Pre-chir or something 沒肚殺 Sercier美人這個角色 其實他logo設計的一個靈感 Okay 所以他整個品牌的 給人的風格呢 就是 三種東西 新鮮的色彩 大量的印花跟 非常非常性感的一些剪裁 這就是整個 Versace他散發出來的一個 品牌的印象 Got it Got it So in English It means that Versace is often characterized by vibrant colors Lots of strong colors Yes Bold prints So big spots Big shapes Big everything Very bold You know Very sharp prints And sexy cuts So the cutting is always very sexy Yes
(19:12~20:13) And very Italian I think Italian brands Tend to be more sexy fitting Because they believe that that's You know that's the beauty in fashion Right And of course with the bold prints Now modern A lot of modern fashion designers Are also very bold The colors and the prints Yes But I believe at that time In the 60s 70s To stand out You have to be different And to be different You have to try bold colors That's right You have to use bold colors To present some of the features of this brand Okay So this is Versace 中文好像叫凡塞斯 This brand Yes Okay So you can go to know this brand Maybe one day You buy some Versace stuff Maybe like perfume or their clothes Oh yes They have everything now today Yes They started off with clothing And you know like with every fashion brand They would start somewhere
(20:13~21:15) Either with the fragrance Or either with the clothing Or either with formal wear Casual wear whatever Yes They would usually extend it Eventually That's right But coming back to the pronunciation How do we know We have to pronounce it Versace Oh that's a good question I don't know Because when the first time I heard of凡塞斯 English I know its code Versace So it's kind of a basic Basic thoughts I think personally I have a hunch This You know don't quote me on this But I think it's because People actually Don't use the Chinese pronunciation Beauty people use the Italian pronunciation More Yes You know So it's been more shared by You know Fashion designers People in who knows fashion So on and so forth Yes So we would see this word V-E-R is V-E-R is V-E-R is In English you are supposed to pronounce it Versace Oh yes
(21:15~22:17) Yes Versace Or Versace Right Some people would say Versace Versace Or Versace So You wouldn't break it in the middle V-E-R S-A-C-E You wouldn't break it in the middle there S-A-C-E Is Sace So Versace Or Versace It's kind of weird It's all Obviously we know the original pronunciation So everything else is weird Yeah That's why it's The Chinese pronunciation 凡塞斯 You see I think they probably couldn't Write the homonym for Sachi Right Yeah It's hard You become like 凡塞斯 Or some things Yes It'll be weird It won't sort of relate very well So they took it more the English approach But some for some odd reason We don't know why But everybody knows
(22:17~23:18) When you see the V-E-R-S-A-C-E You pronounce it Versace It's cool You become Italian Do you know John I the first time I write this This word to the Google translation In English type They still pronounce it Versace So it's not a brand's name So everybody kind of a reflection They will know Versace It's called Versace Yes Exactly So you see if you become a global icon Or cultural icon People will pronounce it your way 好 這就是第二個品牌 Versace 凡塞斯 Very nice The third one is still a luxury brand So what kind of luxury brand Because we had chocolate We had something to do with food And then we had something to do with fashion This one car Oh not car But it's kind of related with man A gentleman will have it On his suit On his suit
(23:18~24:18) Not a suit Yes It's a fountain pens brand Fountain pen Yeah Fountain pen would have to be Lamy I don't lamy fountain pen But luxury Okay, Lamy is sort of your middle class brand I have to say we have to kind of focus on This brand is hard to pronounce When we first time to see it You maybe don't know how to read it We can kind of thought about this part Maybe you will think about the brand Not waterman Not waterman So another one Not waterman It's kind of related with some European mountains Oh Mont Blanc Yes Mont Blanc Yes Okay 沒錯 這個第三個品牌是萬寶龍 萬寶龍鋼筆 這個應該是 大家聽到鋼筆就會 可能很快就會聯想到的一個品牌之一 So not a new fountain pen Normal ballpoint pens Ink pens
(24:18~25:25) Yeah Stationary General And then of course they are also Quite well known It depends on you know what budget you have You can also go for their suitcases Brief cases Their bags, backpacks Their leatherware Yes 表帶之類的東西 就是比較偏向男性的商品居多了 Okay 他是成立在1906年德國柏林的一個牌子 那當然鋼筆之前在我周高十公斤的節目裡面 也有稍微介紹過這個鋼筆的一些發展演變 那其實就是在20世紀初期開始大量出現的 那萬寶龍這個品牌呢 就大概是1910年代那個時候 開始能見度越來越高 那之所以叫做Mont Blanc 他是為什麼呢 因為是選用了一個歐洲非常有名的山 Okay Which mountain is that? Can John tell us? So it's the highest peak in the Alps And that peak is called Mont Blanc Yes The white mountain
(25:25~26:25) 萬寶龍的英文如果大家有去查過叫做M-O-N-T-B-L-A-N-C But we pronounce it Mont Blanc Why doesn't the C have to pronounce it? It's kind of like Louis Vuitton We don't pronounce it the way yet Yeah Okay First of all, we have to look at the origin Okay The origin of this brand The origin is Germany, right? Yes, Germany But the brand characteristic, their logo Is a mountain in the Alps, right? The peak in the Alps And that's named in French Oh Not German Yeah Not German, it's French So that's why it's sort of the Louis Vuitton You would miss and omit some letters Okay And here is a couple of interesting things about the pronunciation M-O-N-T-Mont Okay
(26:25~27:27) I'm pronouncing it Mont Technically in French, there's no T So it's Mont Mont Yeah So M-O-N-T means mountain Ah, mountain Do you see? It's very close, right? Mont If you pronounce it in English, Mont So it's like mountain And then Blanc or Blanc Sometimes you pronounce, you know, I would do That, you know, pronounce the C still B-L-A-N-C Blanc We all know in many many instances Including your white wine Oh, white wine That's also Blanc Oh So it's on the label So if you go to the stores And you will see B-L-A-N-C Yes Nine out of ten times That is white It means white So Mont Blanc For people in the west It's easy to understand It's the white mountain Yes But in French, Mont
(27:27~28:29) The T is omitted So Mont And then Blanc B-L-A-N-C Some people in Northern America Also in Europe or myself You know, I would You know, I would pronounce everything Mont Blanc Yeah Okay I used to do that And then once you get educated about the French pronunciation You will omit the T and the C So it's Mont Blanc Okay 好 那我再來跟大家補充一下 萬寶龍這個品牌 其實就像剛剛前面講 他最一開始的這個商品 其實是以鋼筆為主 但是到了大概1997年之後呢 他就開始研發出了不同的商品 譬如說皮革的配件啊 錶帶等等 那當然就是為了拓展他自己在 南西蘋市場的一些 市場的份額嘛 後來在1998年的時候 這個Mont Blanc呢 被另外一個大型的集團叫做 瑞士的利豐集團給收購了 那這個品牌底下呢 還有卡蒂亞跟Coy 這兩個奢侈品的品牌 所以變成的是一個
(28:29~29:33) 奢侈品大集團底下的一個夥伴哦 Okay I know that John has a trivia about Mont Blanc It's very interesting 啊哈 Because you mentioned the group that acquired Mont Blanc Yeah Okay Mont Blanc was an independent company And then eventually got acquired by a company called Richmond Richman Okay Richmond Okay But again, we are supposed to pronounce it French So this one is still French Richmonde Yeah, it's supposed to be like that But you know, I hate sort of speaking funny like that Okay So anyway, Richmond This group is a luxury brand group Mmm They are the parent company Operant group of Cartier and Chloe And so this group Richmond I want you to guess Although it's based in Switzerland
(29:33~30:38) But which country is the founder from Maybe like French Most likely, right? Most likely a Frenchman Or Italian guy Or possibly an Englishman Even Yeah, we also think about the luxury brand We will think about these countries Yeah Yeah, so is this answer correct? No Oh no No, Richmond It was founded by a South African billionaire Oh South African billionaire Yes And they own Richmond And Yohan Rupert is the second generation His father Anton Rupert Is a tycoon in mining, in finance In a lot of things Ah 那時候是 雖然是礦產大亨 And also tobacco Very early days They were also involved in tobacco as well Ah, okay Yeah, so Anton Rupert Is a tycoon
(30:38~31:38) And then his son, Johan Rupert, founded Richmond And then he started acquiring all these luxury brands Oh, this rich generation has acquired these luxury brands And then they have acquired these luxury brands And then they have acquired these luxury brands So there are three major companies or groups today In the world that controls almost 60 to 80% of all the luxury brands that we saw That we know of in the market So the three is LVMH Caring And Richmond That's right 我記得這個LVMH We know that inflation these years are very very serious problem But LVMH their stock price has come to a very high record high Yeah, record high high place And it even moved the French stock market to the top Yes You know that inflation is none of the rich man's business
(31:38~32:40) They don't even care about it, like 2% It's not my business like that Inflation does not affect luxury goods too much That's right Yes, they've proven that And so they're still very powerful brands And they are very powerful companies Okay 剛剛提到這個鋼筆 可能去想像一下 一直鋼筆要多貴 是不是 那我其實網路上有查到一些資料 就是Mont Blanc 他最貴的一隻鋼筆呢 叫做這個TageMahar的限量版鋼筆 限量版聽到這個名字就知道 他應該是要價不菲哦 之所以這麼貴呢 其實不外乎就是這個鋼筆上面 香了很多不同的寶石 從鑽石啊藍寶石啊到紅寶石等等 哦那總共這個太基馬哈林系列 總共有三隻不同的鋼筆 名字都很夢幻啦 第一隻叫月之類 第二隻叫做黑色神話 第三隻叫做權力 那致敬的就是蓋出太基馬哈林的 這個Mont Blanc朝 大家可能好奇他的價格嘛
(32:40~33:42) 三隻基本上都是200萬usd 的旗跳啊 摺合臺幣下來大概就六七千萬元 哈哈哈哈 ok so let's put it this way i don't think it's for sale it's probably one of those pieces that represent the brand yeah also the craftsmanship you know the ability to create to make a pen in such luxury 他要像著這個品牌他的價值在哪裡 it's not about using the pen you won't use a two millionusd dollar pen no way i would never use this kind of pen if i 不能說要地上我那個太心痛了 but i can tell you their watches are pretty nice you know i'm a big fan of watches you can go and definitely check out the Mont Blanc watches very very good with your suit for formal wear personally i'm a big fan oh ok 我還沒有想到萬寶龍還真的不會想讓他們的手錶都會 直覺就聯想到鋼筆哦
(33:42~34:43) ok maybe someday i can learn about their watch yes yes i guess it it you know it's like fashion every six or ten years it goes around so maybe the past ten twenty years it's all about the watch and then the next coming ten twenty years you know people use more chat gbt and computers and now we go back to pens maybe yeah maybe another ten years we'll talk about the vision pro yeah exactly the br br device or something yes ok好那今天這三個品牌我們帶跟大家複習 the first one very famous chocolate luxury brand good diva or good diva yes if you hear good diva don't correct the guy come on ok good diva is fine but you know obviously if we want to stick to the Belgian roots then good diva it is good diva ok ok the second one 這個凡塞斯how do we pronounce it versace versace ok versace sounds very very fancy
(34:43~35:46) and it is the last name of jianni versace so for them it's the same as gucci it's they call themselves the house of gucci or the house of the sachi because it's a family brand yes 大膽用色設計非常的性感 然後大量的這種大大幅度的剪裁的這個 奢侈品就是versace ok第三個呢 是一個 gombi的品牌叫做萬寶龍 and mon blanc mon blanc ok you don't you don't pronounce the t and the c don't pronounce the t and the c but i like to pronounce the t and the c you know it's just a bad habit of mine i have to pronounce every later so if you hear me say mon blanc there we go please forgive me and maybe one day you know what patrick when one day we get sponsored by mom blanc we will read it the right way of course we have to read it the right way ok yes好ok那我們今天就是分享這三個 那當然也跟大家補充一下就是
