(00:00~01:02) 曾經在節目中分享過不少的成語典故 今天來聊聊三個有關於英文諺語背後的故事 這一次的特別單集呢 邀請了通勤學英語的教老師 注意本集還有大量的英文對話 認識歷史也練習英文 一起來挑戰看看 你能聽懂多少吧 生活周遭的歷史大小事歡迎收聽周報時光機我是主持人派翠克 我們今天是一個百靈果的感覺喔 除了中文之外呢 也找了另外一個這個 今年2022年 教育類型排行榜前三名的通勤學英語的教老師
(01:02~02:03) 來跟我們分享一些關於英文諺語的故事跟一些用法啦 Hey guys, thank you for having me. This is John from 15minz.today. So Patrick, this is a very special episode for both of us because you do a lot of history and also backstories and I specialize in English So what are we going to bring to the table for our listeners today? 我們之前在周報時光機都會聽到一些成語的典故跟成語的背後的故事 那當然今天是一個feet 畢竟通勤學英語是叫英文的 我們除了中文這個語言有成語之外 英文也有他的諺語他的慣用語還有他的騙語 So today 我們找了John老師 要來我們feet這個special episode就是要來講一些ediums There we go. So today we're going to be talking about some of the interesting idioms that intrigues Patrick personally to be honest. You like these idioms so I'm going to help you out And let's see if we can
(02:03~03:04) both learn something from each other. You tell me some history and I will show you how to use the idioms. How's that? 我們今天學很多英文喔除了學英文當然大家最喜歡聽的就是一些起源的故事嘛 So today我們知道今年是一個rabbit year 2年 所以我們今天第一個諺語呢要來跟大家分享的 請John老師幫我念一下 Ok so our first idiom for today is going down the rabbit hole going down the rabbit hole是什麼意思呢 等一下我們會請John老師來解釋 但是聽到rabbit hole 我想先來問一下John老師 John老師他之前是在南非 長大的嘛 一面到南非長大的 So do you have ever seen a rabbit hole? to be honest with you no No So here's the thing Most of the rabbits in South Africa Because South Africa the environment and the weather is very dry So we have continental climate unlike the marine climate in Taiwan
(03:04~04:04) So there's no place to hide it's very very dry 太乾燥沒有辦法挖洞 Exactly so it's not easy So we have more lizards and other type of animals Maybe hare but very very small Not so much rabbit So the only rabbit we see is the same rabbits we see in Taiwan In the pet shops Pet shops 所以沒有那麼野兔就對了 我以為非洲會有很多大野兔 So that's my mistake We have very big animals But in terms of rabbits they don't get big It's not a good environment for them to grow You know you for rabbits they need to hide First of all they need to dig holes And also they must be pasture So a lot of green grass But in South Africa it's very dry so No grass Almost no grass I see Ok好 我們回到咽語上面 咽語 剛剛講的going down to rabbit hole 2年呢 我們來跟一個兔子有關的咽語 到底是什麼意思呢 我們剛剛都知道 Rabbit hole 野兔會挖洞嘛
(04:04~05:05) 剛剛講老師有講 他是要保護自己有安全感 來遮風避雨的 那其實這句咽語呢 我們想要Rabbit hole就是 洞穴是一個非常神祕的地方 它其實咽語是取自於愛麗絲夢遊陷阱 Ah Alice in Wonderland Yes Alice in Wonderland 這應該是蠻多人以前 會讀過的一個fairy tale 這樣老師有看過嗎 Yes of course Of course But did you know Patrick That the original story The title of Alice in Wonderland Was actually sort of the second version if you will The original was called Alice through the looking glass At least 看鏡子 So Alice actually went into a dream world Through the glass So the rabbit hole Technically before the rabbit hole She was already in a fantasy world 哇 我真的沒聽過 大家就學到一個資訊
(05:05~06:06) Only oldies like me know this It's old fashion Very old school stuff 好那我們知道這個 剛剛提到的愛麗絲夢遊陷阱 我們來跟大家解釋一下 其實它是一本在1865年 一個英國作家叫Louise Kahlo 她所寫的一個小說 那她形容的這樣子就是 我們來跟大家複習一下 愛麗絲的故事 小女孩愛麗絲呢 她有一天在樹下 跟她姐姐起來那邊看書 結果看著看著呢 她就看到遠方有一隻野兔 手上拿著一懷錶 結果這還開口講人的話 她就覺得哇 這個野兔怎麼那麼神奇 於是她就好奇的追了上去 結果一不小心 就掉進了兔子洞裡面 展開了一連串的 這個奇幻的冒險 There we go So Patrick Do you think she went down the rabbit hole or she fell down the rabbit hole Maybe fell down She fell down accidentally Yeah accidentally You think I think Well most of people who read Alice in Wonderland think she went down the rabbit hole Oh To chase after To chase the rabbit
(06:06~07:09) That fantasy right That adventure like Oh there's a rabbit that can talk That's so cool So she was curious She was bored actually 但如果是我看到一個神祕的洞穴 I'll be afraid I won't get inside This is too dangerous Exactly So a lot of people who think She fell down the rabbit hole By accident So to kick start her adventure that way That was whole Everything was a coincidence But technically If you think about this idiom today Going down the rabbit hole You in a way Is intentionally You are wanting to go You deliberately want to go down this rabbit hole 你是想要進去到這個圖子裡面的 There we go So in a way If you think about it This rabbit hole Was it good for Alice? Maybe it was an adventure But really was it a good adventure for her? She went through a lot of tough things that challenged her 沒錯 Yes she was
(07:09~08:11) You know that rabbit hole was not very good So in a way The way we use this idiom is the same If you fell down the rabbit hole That means you accidentally You didn't intentionally want to go down 對你不是故意要進去的 There we go But if you want to go down the rabbit hole It's on you 哦 所以 我們來稍微收攏一下 其實她不是意外掉進 你想要 因為我們用的動詞 是going down the rabbit hole 所以你是主動進到這個圖子洞裡面的 所以她有一點 像是沉迷於某一種 這個圖子洞裡面的事物的感覺 Because you know There's something interesting there Maybe maybe not So you are interested You want to go down the rabbit hole Want to discover the rabbit hole Yes you are curious But if you fall down the rabbit hole Again we got to look at the situation Did somebody kick you and you fell Or was it an accident that you walked on the street And you happen to fall into the rabbit hole So two different situations
(08:11~09:13) So that's where we can use this idiom as well So if you intentionally want to pursue something very difficult Or that may not bring you any benefits Then you go down the rabbit hole So you will tell your friend Woh oh oh oh oh Don't go down the rabbit hole I know you are curious Don't go there 不要莫名於探知一個位置的領域的感覺 Ok But if something happened to you And one day I come back to you and I say Patrick Oh last Friday My gosh You know I shouldn't have turned on Netflix Because I fell into the rabbit hole I didn't want to watch so much movies and TV series I don't really want to watch so many movies and so many series But you know I got stuck in that rabbit hole I spent the whole weekend watching movies and TV series Stuck inside a Netflix accidentally Yes exactly So these are the two ways we can use it
(09:13~10:13) 所以你可以說是沉迷於新事物 或者是不小心掉進裡面 然後陷入在裡面出不來 有點像是現在其實很多人都會說 沉迷於網路的感覺 就可以用going down the rabbit hole Exactly So a lot of people win down online game or mobile game I don't think that's fair But if we say TikTok It's a rabbit hole Don't go down the TikTok rabbit hole Yeah 一個影片才15秒 滑滑滑滑 半天就沒了 就是一些TikTok 有些影片 覺得很好看很好看 就15秒15秒15秒 一天就這樣過了 So you will tell your friend to not go down that rabbit hole TikTok rabbit hole So it'll work Yes Ok 所以我們今天第一個諺語 再來跟大家講講 going down the rabbit hole 好像沉迷於新事物 或者是東西吸住 然後出不來那種感覺 There we go Ok we will go to the second one Ok First of all I would like to ask John 老師 你是狗人還是狗人 我是狗人還是狗人 要說真的
(10:13~11:13) 在南非 我還有兩隻狗 哦 我還有兩隻狗 還有一隻狗 他們不會打嗎 不會 還有我們還有一隻Tortis Tortis 我們還有Tortis 你知道那一隻 我不知道那一隻Tortis是什麼樣的 但是它是一隻很大的Tortis 陸龜 嗯 Ok 所以你還有兩隻狗和一隻狗 對 所以你比較像一個狗人 哈哈哈 嗯 funny enough 我們和狗人一起住 我們有狗人在每個年 然後我們有狗人 啤梨 然後我們有 你知道 second generation 狗人 然後等等 所以我們有夠的 garden space 哦 我們有狗 我們有狗 我們有狗人 說話 about rabbits 對 但是我們狗人殺了狗 哦 在想要被牠們殺掉後 嗯嗯 然後我哥哥哭了 他心裡哭了 因為我哥哥 嗯 我哥哥的生日禮物其實 哦
(11:13~12:14) 所以我們把牠們殺掉 在地上 然後狗們來殺掉狗 然後 對 然後你知道 我們18歲之後 哈哈哈 所以你意思是 那天他有狗 然後狗 對 哦 然後狗 他們 對 他們殺了狗 哇 那一拿到生日禮物的兔子 馬上就被狗爹 我哥哥哭了 他在地上哭了 他只有6歲 然後他 他心裡哭了 哦 那是 很可憐 然後我媽媽就說 我沒有狗可以這樣做 哈哈哈 然後之後我們有狗 因為我媽媽 她沒有狗人 嗯嗯 但是 一天她去了某個家 我不知道誰的家 我不知道她從哪裡找到的資料 Anyway, she came back and she's like So John I'm going to get a cat You want to come see Well And I'm like Why do we want a cat? I was almost 14 then So I thought I don't really care
(12:14~13:14) You know being a teenager Whatever you want mom I was at that stage You know So we went to see We went to this white lady's house Someway we drove 25 minutes I don't even know How my mom knew the place Anyway so what happened was Her cat had a litter of kittens Oh she needed somebody to To come and adopt the kittens So my mom went And she was like go pick one Ah pick one So you pick two No no no no We had we had I only had to pick one But I was like I don't know cats Oh you don't know I don't know cats Just pick one you like There we go There we go You know it's like going shopping Any mean to my anymore And then So I just look at one And I'm like I'm trying to you know Feel all of them and see Which one responds to me And then the one that responded to me We just brought it home We adopted it And then we became You know we had a cat
(13:14~14:14) And then my mom was like No no no we got to protect the cat Because now we got two massive dogs Adult dogs That are adult sized And we got one kitten Maybe not a very good mix Right So we kept the kitten in the house And the dogs They would look through the glass window And like look at the Staring Yeah They bring out the cat And I'm like No no no no no So they they had that relationship So over the window They so they won't 如果你們放在同一個空間裡面 可能就有可能打架了 We don't want to do that Oh no no no Maybe you'll be the rabbit Ok好既然 cats 比較多 那我們今天第二個演員 就來講一下 來請 John老師幫我們念一下這個言語 So the second idiom for today is Cat got your tongue Cat got your tongue 貓拿到你的舌頭 欸這是什麼意思呢 欸那個貓跟舌頭有什麼樣的關係哦 我們現在跟大家解釋一下 這故事從哪裡來 主要是從古埃及人啊
(14:14~15:15) 因為我們都知道 這個 Asians Egyptians Yes 他們都喜歡貓 他們對貓有崇拜的感覺哦 當時聽說這個只要有說謊啊 或者是蟹毒生命的人 懲罰的方法就是把你的舌頭給割掉 拿去餵貓 Ok所以他們當時就有這樣的想法 所以 言語呢 當初就是來自於這邊哦 那怎麼樣的解釋 問一下John老師 So how did they become an idiom cat got your tongue Ok so There's another story where this comes from But I think cat got your tongue in the modern sense I'll leave the history up to you Padme I won't take you know it's your turn That's your feel But cat got your tongue became something of like a comeback You are telling the other person Hey cat got your tongue Why can't you speak So it's it's sort of an attack on the person 有點像吵架的時候 講不出話啦 Yeah
(15:15~16:16) So it's an attack on the person like hey Do you have more cat got your tongue Huh Huh 有點挑釁的一位 So whether or not In history they use that that way But in modern times it became something of a mouth fight If you're in mouth fight with somebody You know you can use this Cat got your tongue Yeah Hey hey hey I can't hear you Cat got your tongue You see it's very insinuous It's very insulting 感覺蠻欠揍的哦 Yeah Ok剛剛John老師來幫我補充 欸我還有另外一個第二個說法哦 就是關於他有第二個歷史故事啦 所以古埃及有提到用貓之外 Hey cat got your tongue 跟英國的海軍有一點關係哦 因為之前呢 英國海軍有一種體法 他們用了一種型句叫做九尾鞭 英文好像叫做Catol Nigh Tells之類的東西 Yes 他們就是like a whip Whip就是哎鞭形的時候 Pia那個東西哦 那因為打這個鞭形 我們都知道打很多下人的屁股 就皮開肉站的吧 所以行行的人 他們還很變態是
(16:16~17:17) 海軍每個人都要上來打一下 輪流執行這個 因此就衍生出這句願意 因為現場 這個真的血肉很肥 非常的可怕財人 大家都很緊張 所以海軍每個人看到都無言以對 就講不出話來 被嚇到那種感覺 ok so this is cat got your tongue 就是哎跟人家吵架 剛剛教育老師講到 哎講不出話 條性的時候就講 Hey cat got your tongue 就有一種感覺啊 That's how you use it In mouth fights if you want to declare that you are a winner That's the final thing you want to say So cat got your tongue And then that person will be like 所以用這個言語還算蠻高級的吧 就是如果你跟人家吵架出了這個言語 ok but the more modern sense of the of this version of how to win a mouth fight is today is called a mic drop or my drop oh hip hop hip hop boy from hip hop culture mic drop means that's the end I impress the crowd done finito oh
(17:17~18:18) 就把麥公公丟在地上 直接回頭就走 yes 非常的帥 我們知道很多 hip hop的唱歌饒舌的人都很喜歡做這個動作 there you go silence的感覺 so in a mouth fight long time ago we would say you know between kids we would like get cat got your tongue cat got your tongue now it will be like might drop talk to the hand I remember that former american president marack obama yes he did the mic drop yes i remember that mean okay okay we'll get the third one 第三個我們今天的最後一個好了 我們今天就分享到這邊 但是第三個 我們剛剛有提到 cat person dog person 所以這一個呢 跟狗有關係哦 狗我們知道他有一個行為叫做廢叫 so what is the idiom oh the idiom is his bark is worse than his bite a bark bark我們知道是狗叫的意思 there we go 他的叫聲比他的 肯咬還要弱 哎這想到會是什麼意思呢 yes 我們可以提到bark is worse than his bite
(18:18~19:19) 就是有點像是刀子嘴豆腐型的意思啦 so Patrick here is the thing with dogs they may look very aggressive yeah or when they bark it's it's loud so it's intimidating you are scared yes but when the bark is worse than his bite that means he can do no more than his bark 嗯嗯 that means his bite is very weak yes so if you use it in a person term to describe a person now it means the person looks tough oh but may not have the guts to really punch you in the face 那可以說他是面惡心戰的人嗎 I would say so I would say so in the right circumstances you can use it in that sense okay so for example if you go to the gym today you see all the muscle man you see all the muscle men out there and their bark is worse than their bite because they are not ma fighters they may have big muscles but it does not mean they have that killer instinct to fight somebody 嗯嗯嗯嗯
(19:19~20:21) ok so we know this bark is worse than his bite 用在人上面可以形容他說 欸這人看起來比較兇惡 兇神惡殺 但其實他內心是一個非常善良的人 is a kind person yes ok there we go I have to ask john have you ever been bitten by a dog yes I have oh yes is that your pet dog bitten you no it was my grandpa's dog oh so before we left to South Africa um I had like I think a year before we left 嗯嗯 moved to South Africa we actually um I still have the bite mark on my wrist oh my god um so what happened was my grandpa's dog at that time it was a street dog so my grandpa picked up the street dog and that's it so what happened was the dog and I you know I'm okay with dogs from young and but what happened that day why the dog bit me was so my grandpa fed couple of bones bones 嗯嗯 to the dog and then
(20:21~21:22) you know I I saw the dog sort of waiting for something I don't know why so I don't know what overcame me I actually went and moved the bone oh my god I went to move the bone I wanted to move it closer to the dog so the dog thought I was trying to take his bone is trying you think you're trying to steal his food exactly oh so I got bitten and then to be honest with you I don't know what happened to that dog afterwards I don't have any memory I just remember you know I was hurt and I was crying like crazy and I don't remember what have you know what happened after but I vaguely remember I think the dog was still there except now my grandpa will you know after then never allowed me to go back to pet the dog or play with the dog but I mean it was more my fault than the dog's fault that was the biggest lesson I had to learn was not to play with dog food there we go
(21:22~22:22) a dog's food or cat food even sometimes if you feed the cats and you you know if you don't have that trust with your pet maybe a straight cat a straight cat yeah they may just bite you 留到貓留到狗 你喂外飄 馬上要收他 食物他可能會攻擊 yes so I mean that was my terrible experience but I mean after that when once we move to South Africa I mean animals is very common you know birds dogs cats 那匠老師你還記得 被咬的那個痛感 I don't I don't I was I was what five and a half oh do you go to the hospital we did we did you are feng you are fengxian so my grandpa lives in Zhongli so I believe I don't know where my dad took me but we drove a good half hour at least also that's a very serious bite ah I don't think so but I mean I mean but at my age five and a half I mean you know all parents would panic
(22:22~23:24) I was being beaten before you were beaten before 我記得我那時候小時候 oh因為我 其實我從小時候我家就以前在陽狗 然後因為我家在臺中 臺中的 我家都是巷子 就是大的鄰居都很接近嘛 然後那時候其實蠻多鄰居家都有陽狗的 那時候是一隻白色的 因為好像米白色的土狗 然後那天 我還以為是還小 like five years old so then we go so we wish them a happy five and a half so I'm playing outside 我們在外面玩哦 然後在外面玩 那結果 可能我媽一直疏忽 結果把門關起來了 oh 然後我要沒有帶鑰匙 so you were outside the fence yeah yeah I'm outside the fence and suddenly the dog came oh and we know hello the idiom says that the bark is worse than his bite however he didn't bark yes his bite is worse than his bark yeah the reverse 他沒有叫 他完全沒有叫 所以狗會攻擊你 他真的就是不會叫 慢慢的接近 there we go 然後我就記得 我那時候屁股一陣疼痛 他是咬我的屁股 但他沒有
(23:24~24:25) 他沒有咬得很大力 因為可能是 其實他知道我這個人 但我可能 maybe stand his to his territory or something 他就一個領地的範圍 very territorial yeah yeah 他們覺得有一個領地性 可能被侵略到 所以他就稍微的咬了我一口 那小朋友就是有痛感 你就是豪桃大哭嘛 所以我一哭 就是整個鄰居都跑出來 怎麼回事怎麼回事 然後才知道那隻狗 就咬了我這樣 但他其實已經是一隻老狗 那個年代 all right 對 然後後來好像 也還可以跟我還是會有互動啊 他可能也不是故意的 yes 所以還就是一個 小時候的記憶 yeah you see we were too little or you know I knew exactly what happened because I went to play with my the dog's food but you probably did something that you didn't realize it caused that particular old dog you know some some anxiety maybe yeah or some sort of you aggravated it you made it angry somehow you just don't know why
(24:25~25:25) maybe you kicked the stone or something or the sound you made or maybe 我背對他也OK yes yes yes 好我們就知道這個 bark is worse than his bite ok 然後只嘴洞服 洗面惡心善的部分 there we go but if a dog bites then yeah it's more it's worse it's the worst part you should always stay away from dogs that bite yeah if they bark it's ok stare them down you can stare them down literally you can look at them and like you come closer I'm gonna fight you 嗯 and they will sort of no they will bark bark bark they will never move forward but the minute they move forward you know oh ok you have to be careful you have to you have to be you know like really really cautious of what you're doing yes to be honest I'm a dog person your dog person but I'm still scared of some dogs you know when我到黃椒野外 到山上 我以前騎車 你喜歡走山 就去 山上遇到一些野狗成羣的時候 我其實還是會怕 可能是 oh true true true 應該小時候的陰影吧 就是被狗咬過
(25:25~26:26) 你就是會怕這樣子 there we go ok 好 所以我們今天呢 學了三個頁 我們再來複習一下 alright 第一個 請教老師再幫我們念一次 ok so the first theme today is to either go down the rabbit hole or fall down the rabbit hole 對 是主動成名呢 還是被動陷入 這感覺 going down the rabbit hole 第二個呢 yes when you are in a mouth fight yes you want to finish it you'd say cat got your tongue cat got your tongue 講不出話了嗎 或者一個比較 modern的說法 就像剛剛老師講的 my drop yes 感覺比較吵一點 ok 好 第三個呢 moving on his bark is worse than his bite ok bark is worse than his bite 刀子嘴豆腐心 面惡心善的人 他可能 長相不是這麼的善良 或者是他的面相 比較兇惡一點 但他其實內心是一個好人 yes ok 好 我們今天學的這三個頁 教給大家 就是之後可以用的是 炫耀一下給你朋友 讓你朋友覺得哇好厲害
